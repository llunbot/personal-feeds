Apple releases new Apple Watch models (called “series”) on a yearly cadence, and the price rarely changes by all that much. So to avoid buying an Apple Watch that is outdated after just a few weeks, you want to time it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has just announced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2451831/apple-watch-series-10-display-health-feautures-ultra-satin-black-milanese-loop.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, so this is a good time to buy. If you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch, see our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch buying guide</a>, and our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672795/best-apple-watch-deals.html\">best Apple Watch deals</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what we know about Apple Watch release dates and when you should or should not buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I buy a new Apple Watch right now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our advice is to buy an Apple Watch Series 10 now, unless you want to wait for a possible Apple Watch SE update next year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has just announced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2451831/apple-watch-series-10-display-health-feautures-ultra-satin-black-milanese-loop.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, which is thinner and slightly larger with a bigger display and faster charging. It is accompanied by a new color for the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Both are available for preorder now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple tends to update the Apple Watch yearly, so once the new models launch in September, you probably won’t see another upgrade until September of the following year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple did not introduce a new Apple Watch SE as expected, so there is a possibility that it will be introduced in the spring of 2025. Excepting that, this is the best time to get in on a new Apple Watch, as there won’t be an update for a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple introduces the new Apple Watch models it usually discontinues older models. When Apple discontinues the older models and introduces the new ones the price of the older models, if you can find them available from a third-party store, usually goes down. So following the introduction of the new Apple Watches you may be able to get a good deal on an older Apple Watch.

If you buy a new Apple Watch in August expect to be kicking yourself a month later when the new model arrives and resellers start to discount the older model to sell it off at a lower price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to buy an Apple Watch isn’t necessarily when a new model launches. If you wait a month or two you might be able to take advantages of sales and price drops from resellers. During October and November we see lots of sales events, such as Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, and you can expect to get some money off at these events. Apple doesn’t discount its products at its own stores, but it does offer vouchers with new purchases from time to time–and Black Friday is one of those times. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple update the Apple Watch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually updates the Apple Watch at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple Event in September</a>. In 2024, it introduces the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2451831/apple-watch-series-10-display-health-feautures-ultra-satin-black-milanese-loop.html\">Series 10</a> and a new color for the year-old Ultra 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not every Apple Watch gets updated every year. The Apple Watch SE can go two or more years between updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more advice read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch buying guide</a>. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5675892e77db0a25b05c9bd72ef03cdde5ac2f310bbf17f2e6a7195befd82e0e","category":"Apple"}
