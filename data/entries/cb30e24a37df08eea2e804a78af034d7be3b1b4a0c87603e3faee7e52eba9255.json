Amazon claims that SpaceX violated a rule against incomplete and inconsistent applications by submitting plans for \"two mutually exclusive configurations\" with \"very different orbital parameters.\" SpaceX says it is pitching two possible configurations in case its preferred setup doesn't work out and says this does not violate the FCC rule.
