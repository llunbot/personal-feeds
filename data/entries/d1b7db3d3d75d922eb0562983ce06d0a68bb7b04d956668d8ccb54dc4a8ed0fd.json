There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's May 21, and today's photo comes from the James Webb Space Telescope. It showcases the coming together of two massive black holes in the early Universe, just 740 million years after the Big Bang.</p>\n<p>Each of the black holes has an estimated mass of roughly 50 million times the mass of our star, the Sun. The discovery of this merger so early in the Universe indicates that the growth of these objects in the centers of galaxies occurred very rapidly.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025716#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025716&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d1b7db3d3d75d922eb0562983ce06d0a68bb7b04d956668d8ccb54dc4a8ed0fd","category":"Tech"}
