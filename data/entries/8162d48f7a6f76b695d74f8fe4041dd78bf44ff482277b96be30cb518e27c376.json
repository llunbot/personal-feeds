When Sagan burst onto the scene in the early 2010s he was heralded as the greatest talent of his generation, and so he proved to be. 121 professional victories later he’d notched up three World Championships, seven Tour de France green jerseys, multiple Grand Tour stages and national titles plus a Tour of Flanders and a Paris-Roubaix cobble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famed for his dry wit, flamboyant riding style and antics on and off the bike – from wheelies to running man celebrations – Sagan became cycling’s poster boy for the better part of his 15 year career. Now retired, Sagan reflects on a life at the top, from the heady highs to the soul-searching lows; explains the importance of team dynamics; gives us his thoughts on today’s riders; and opens up about a recently discovered heart condition that could have ended his life and has ended up costing him any further professional racing career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James and Will also discuss the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-cycling-esports-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\"> UCI Cycling eSports World Championships</a>, ridden on the MyWhoosh virtual racing platform, for which Sagan is ambassador.
