As we write this, it has been retweeted 288 times and received 885,000 views.</p>\n<p>“Trying to get everyone to license training data is not going to work because that's not what copyright is about,” Jeffries wrote. “Copyright law is about preventing people from producing exact copies or near exact copies of content and posting it for commercial gain. Period. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying or simply does not understand how copyright works.”</p>\n<p>This article is written by two authors. One of us is a journalist who has been on the copyright beat for nearly 20 years. The other is a law professor who has taught dozens of courses on IP and Internet law. We’re pretty sure we understand how copyright works. And we’re here to warn the AI community that it needs to take these lawsuits seriously.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004168#p3\">Read 67 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004168&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
