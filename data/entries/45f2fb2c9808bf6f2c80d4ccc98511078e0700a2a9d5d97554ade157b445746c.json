The brand recently announced the latest licensed <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/get-truckin-but-watch-your-speed-with-state-bicycle-co-s-grateful-dead-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration with the Grateful Dead</a>, celebrating the band’s 60th anniversary. The iconic band adopted the name ‘The Grateful Dead’ in 1965, and began a decades-long journey of popularizing the jam rock genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retrospec’s limited-edition collection includes several models of ebikes, adult bikes, and kids’ bikes (plus five stand-up paddleboards) all adorned with the Grateful Dead’s signature graphics. The adult bikes encourage you to discover the wonders of nature with all styles covered. The collection includes an electric trike, a beach cruiser, a commuter, a gravel bike, a fixie, and a klunker.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Harper-SS-front.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"867\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Harper-SS-front.webp\" alt=\"Retrospec Grateful Dead Collection, Harper, front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Harper-SS-front.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Harper-SS-front-297x215.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Harper-SS-front-120x87.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Harper-SS-front-768x555.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From casual listeners who know their big hits to dedicated tour-followers, The Grateful Dead wasn’t just your weird Uncle John’s Band. They struck a chord with many, including Ely Khakshouri, the CEO of Retrospec.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The Grateful Dead has been the soundtrack to many of my dawn-til-dusk hikes and thousands of miles of road travel through some of my favorite places and experiences worldwide,”</em> said Retrospec CEO Ely Khakshouri. <em>“We’re thrilled to celebrate the Dead’s 60th anniversary with this collection of limited-edition gear, which resonates with the band’s deep connection with the outdoor community. The Grateful Dead inspires spontaneity, creativity, curiosity and fun-loving – virtues we live by daily thanks in great part to the music.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retrospec x Grateful Dead Collection – ebikes:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Koa Rev+ 2 – $2049.99</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Koa-Rev-Plus-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"879\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Koa-Rev-Plus-2.webp\" alt=\"Retrospec Grateful Dead Collection, Koa Rev+ 2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Koa-Rev-Plus-2.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Koa-Rev-Plus-2-297x218.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Koa-Rev-Plus-2-120x88.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Retrospec-Grateful-Dead-Collection-Koa-Rev-Plus-2-768x563.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Koa Rev+ 2 is an electric hardtail with an 80mm suspension fork.
