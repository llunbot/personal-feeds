{"title":"Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to ‘Gulf of America’, for American Users Only","link":"https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1884012692048166951","date":1738112422000,"content":"\n<p>Google, in an announcement on X:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We\nhave a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they\nhave been updated in official government sources.</p>\n\n<p>For geographic features in the U.S., this is when <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis\">Geographic\nNames Information\nSystem</a>\n(GNIS) is updated. When that happens, we will update Google Maps\nin the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America.</p>\n\n<p>Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between\ncountries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in\nthe rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jennifer Elias, reporting for CNBC:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google’s maps division on Monday reclassified the U.S. as a\n“sensitive country,” a designation it reserves for states with\nstrict governments and border disputes, CNBC has learned. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Some team members within the maps division were ordered to\nurgently make changes to the location name and recategorize the\nU.S. from “non-sensitive” to “sensitive,” according to the\ninternal correspondence. The changes were given a rare “P0” order,\nmeaning it had the highest priority level and employees were\nimmediately notified and instructed to drop what they were doing\nto work on it.</p>\n\n<p>Google’s order states that the Gulf of America title change should\nbe treated similar to the Persian Gulf, which in Arab countries is\ndisplayed on Google Maps as Arabian Gulf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No word from Apple on how Apple Maps will handle this. (I’ve asked for comment; will update if I get an answer.) Re-renaming Denali back to Mount McKinley seems like a no-brainer for the maps to comply with. A country names its own mountains. If Obama could rename it, Trump can re-rename it.</p>\n\n<p>The Gulf of Mexico, though, is an international body of water, and its name wasn’t even debated until Trump started talking about it a few weeks ago. Google (and perhaps Apple) having a policy where they simply follow the naming conventions of the GNIS seems not merely sensible but utterly uncontroversial ... until now.</p>\n\n<p>There are three countries in the world that don’t use the metric system as their official units of measure: the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar. I expect there will be fewer — namely, one — who go along with calling it the “Gulf of America”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e66ca6892aa7142e3844ced3b9605352ebd904c980c26c24dc949737e31c517d","category":"Tech"}
