The system is expected to add a 5-6x optical zoom to Apple's next premium iPhone model (the current iPhone 14 Pro supports up to 3x optical zoom).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrevious reports suggested Largan Precision would be the sole supplier of the periscope system. Largan's periscope lenses were first to launch in 2019, when they debuted in the Huawei P30 Pro smartphone. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, industry sources cited by <em><a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230418PD213/apple-iphone-largan.html\">DigiTimes</a></em> now claim that Genius Electronic Optical (GSEO) has been identified as an additional supplier of the module. GSEO shipped periscope lenses to a Japanese handset vendor in 2021, the outlet's sources said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple industry analyst Kuo believes both iPhone 16 Pro models in 2024 will use the same or similar periscope lens as the one used exclusively in the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, with Apple continuing its trend of setting apart standard and Pro models by reserving certain higher-end hardware features for the latter.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/periscope-lens/\">Periscope Lens</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/19/iphone-15-periscope-lens-new-supplier/\">Apple Likely to Add Second Periscope Lens Supplier for iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-add-second-periscope-lens-supplier-for-iphone-15-pro-max.2387200/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fe35f07e781e9ac63acd9f3b09ee6986534bfa7b167f453c70c2761c24e34ff","category":"Apple"}
