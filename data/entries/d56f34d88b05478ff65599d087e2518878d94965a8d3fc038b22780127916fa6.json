Here are some launches that got my attention.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-opus-model-on-amazon-bedrock/\"><strong>Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus now available in Amazon Bedrock</strong></a> – After Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku, two of the three state-of-the-art models of Anthropic’s Claude 3, Opus is now available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. Cluade 3 Opus is at the forefront of generative AI, demonstrating comprehension and fluency on complicated tasks at nearly human levels. Like the rest of the Claude 3 family, Opus can process images and return text outputs. Claude 3 Opus shows an estimated twofold gain in accuracy over Claude 2.1 on difficult open-ended questions, reducing the likelihood of faulty responses.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/meta-llama-3-foundation-models-aws/\">Meta Llama 3 now available in Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</a></strong> – Meta Llama 3 is now available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker\">Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</a>, a machine learning (ML) hub that can help you accelerate your ML journey. You can deploy and use Llama 3 foundation models (FMs) with a few steps in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio\">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a> or programmatically through the <a href=\"https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">Amazon SageMaker Python SDK</a>. Llama is available in two parameter sizes, 8B and 70B, and can be used to support a broad range of use cases, with improvements in reasoning, code generation, and instruction following. The model will be deployed in an AWS secure environment under your VPC controls, helping ensure data security.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/19/AWSNEWS-1930-jumpstart.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/04/19/AWSNEWS-1930-jumpstart.png\" width=\"2564\" height=\"1178\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-sagemaker-studio-notebooks-data-sql-query/\">Built-in SQL extension with Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks</a></strong> – SageMaker Studio’s JupyterLab now includes a built-in SQL extension to discover, explore, and transform data from various sources using SQL and Python directly within the notebooks.
