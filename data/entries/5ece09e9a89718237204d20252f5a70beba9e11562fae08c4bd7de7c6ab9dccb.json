Still, Gurman says that the new computers \"should still go on sale by the time the current MacBook Pro hits its two-year anniversary.\" Context suggests he is talking about the second anniversary of the 16-inch model, not the 13-inch one. That model went on sale on November 13, 2019.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787486#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787486&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ece09e9a89718237204d20252f5a70beba9e11562fae08c4bd7de7c6ab9dccb","category":"Tech"}
