{"title":"Anchor Brewing Is Shutting Down After 127 Years","link":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/wine/article/anchor-steam-18192913.php","date":1689208425000,"content":"\n<p>Jess Lander and Caleb Pershan, reporting sad news for the San Francisco Chronicle:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>San Francisco institution Anchor Brewing Co., the godfather of\nsteam beer, is shutting down after 127 years. The brewery was\n“losing millions of dollars a year,” said Anchor spokesperson Sam\nSinger. “Economic pressures have made the business no longer\nsustainable.”</p>\n\n<p>Anchor has already brewed its final beer at the historic Potrero\nHill brewery — “there’s no steam coming out of the brewery now,”\nsaid Singer — and notified the brewery’s 61 employees of the\nshutdown early Wednesday morning. The brewery’s taproom, Anchor\nPublic Taps, will continue operating until at least Aug. 1,\npossibly longer.</p>\n\n<p>The news comes one month after Anchor announced it was halting\nnational distribution and discontinuing its beloved Christmas Ale,\nwhich it has produced since 1975. When Japanese beer giant Sapporo\npurchased Anchor in 2017, the company was already “in the red,”\naccording to Singer, who said that revenue is down by two-thirds\nsince 2016. The pandemic was especially challenging for the\nbrewery, added Singer, as it typically sells most of its beer\nthrough bars and restaurants. The brewery attempted to expand its\nretail distribution but was “unable to break through in a big\nenough way,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a shame. “Drink local” is always good advice, and Anchor Steam in San Francisco was always delicious. I’m not sure why they ever distributed Anchor Steam nationally, though — it was one of the worst-travelling beers I’ve ever had. Local and fresh: delicious. Trucked to the east coast: meh. Before I tried in San Francisco I always wondered what the fuss was about.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/12/anchor\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e035fb29aa4fdb78133b0abe00dcaea7b25e2c878b83275ef9fe0157d058b8ed","category":"Tech"}
