These new bearings represent a significant push forward in suspension bearing tech.  They feature a unique lubricant-infused foam polymer that is injection-molded into the bearing assembly. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-cutaway-jpeg-e1728592649190.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-cutaway-jpeg-e1728592649190.webp\" alt=\"Enduro Bearings MAX Solid Lube, Black Oxide bearing line cutaway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-cutaway-jpeg-e1728592649190.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-cutaway-jpeg-e1728592649190-297x141.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-cutaway-jpeg-e1728592649190-120x57.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-cutaway-jpeg-e1728592649190-768x364.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This polymer replaces any traditional grease or oils that are typically found in bearings. The solid lube polymer fills up the entire bearing cavity. This leaves virtually no room for contaminants or moisture to get in there and create unwanted friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-writing-on-side-jpeg-e1728592684556.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"582\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-writing-on-side-jpeg-e1728592684556.webp\" alt=\"Enduro Bearings MAX Solid Lube, Black Oxide bearing line writing on side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-writing-on-side-jpeg-e1728592684556.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-writing-on-side-jpeg-e1728592684556-297x135.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-writing-on-side-jpeg-e1728592684556-120x55.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-writing-on-side-jpeg-e1728592684556-768x349.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing to help keep the bearings free of filth/muck, the new MAX Solid Lube, Black Oxide bearings include “double-lip LLU full contact seals and a tough, surface-penetrating Black Oxide/Magnetite bearing race treatment to increase corrosion resistance and material normalization”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-orange-seal-jpeg-e1728592711672.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-orange-seal-jpeg-e1728592711672.webp\" alt=\"Enduro Bearings MAX Solid Lube, Black Oxide bearing line orange seal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-orange-seal-jpeg-e1728592711672.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-orange-seal-jpeg-e1728592711672-297x156.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-orange-seal-jpeg-e1728592711672-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Enduro-Bearings-MAX-Solid-Lube-Black-Oxide-bearing-line-orange-seal-jpeg-e1728592711672-768x404.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>We’re always looking for ways to improve bicycle bearing performance and durability,</em> says Matt Harvey, co-founder of Enduro Bearings. “<em>Our MAX Solid Lube, Black Oxide pivot bearings are perfect for demanding applications where performance and reliability are critical and regular maintenance is burdensome.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enduro’s proprietary, all-conditions MAX Solid Lube solution is made up of two parts. First, “a continuous microporous polymer and a proprietary lubricant containing special additives”. Secondly, then the MAX Solid Lube interacts with the moving balls, it is then transferred from “millions of pores to the ball and race surfaces”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the bearing continues to move, the combined temperature and pressure release a uniform and continuous film of lubrication. This coating covers all metal parts to minimize friction, in turn, extending bearing life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the bearing movement stops, “capillary action returns the lubricant to the polymer’s micropores when it will be stored for future bearing movements”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MAX Solid Lube, Black Oxide pivot bearing line includes ten of the most popular 6800 and 6900 series bearings. Additional sizes will be added in the coming months and years ahead.
