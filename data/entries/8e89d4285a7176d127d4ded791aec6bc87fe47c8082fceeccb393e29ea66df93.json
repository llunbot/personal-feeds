And its latest project—an electric Land Rover Defender conversion—could see its tech wind up on your driveway.</p>\n<p>Land Rover's now defunct \"old\" Defender is a ripe candidate for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/how-ev-technology-is-bringing-hot-rodding-into-the-21st-century/3/\">an EV restomod</a>. There's space for motors, batteries, and various other sundries within; in certain parts of the world, you'll find yourself tripping over them without trying. For some reason, people go all gooey with nostalgia over them, so they don't mind throwing money at their perfect Landie. There are plenty out there already—the UK military is <a href=\"https://expeditionportal.com/british-army-to-electrify-classic-land-rover-defenders-with-electrogenic/\">looking into converting</a> some of its fleet of Defenders into EVs, while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/this-range-rover-classic-restomod-runs-on-tesla-power/\">restomod companies will sell you</a> one upholstered with the skin of an exotic creature, and numerous others promise <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/want-a-boxy-suv-that-runs-on-batteries-check-out-the-twisted-nas-e/\">super silent cruising</a> up and down the lumps and bumps of the world.</p>\n<p>Whereas most will rip out the diesel motor and replace it with a traditional EV powertrain, BEDEO's method is different. Rather than mounting the motor(s) on the chassis, connected to the wheels by driveshafts, the company hub-mounts them, putting a motor in each wheel, saving room elsewhere to avoid encroaching on space previously used by oily bits.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025856#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025856&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e89d4285a7176d127d4ded791aec6bc87fe47c8082fceeccb393e29ea66df93","category":"Tech"}
