The Retrofitting service analyzes the frameset itself and its origins to verify the bike’s authenticity, and then officially certifies and registers it in a modern logbook of known Colnago bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-steel-cool-Master-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-steel-cool-Master-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colnago Retrofitting road bike authenticity verification service, old-school steel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-steel-cool-Master-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-steel-cool-Master-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-steel-cool-Master-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-steel-cool-Master-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-carbon-cool-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-carbon-cool-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colnago Retrofitting road bike authenticity verification service, old school carbon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-carbon-cool-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-carbon-cool-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-carbon-cool-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_old-school-carbon-cool-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago owners (<em>or suspected owners</em>) submit photos, a description, and evidence like a frame’s serial number or purchase invoice to Colnago.

Linked to a secure digital passport for new &amp; vintage bikes alike on the MyLime blockchain, this little smart tag can join your frame’s tubing series decal for a technological ‘retrofit’.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why put an NFC tag on a vintage bike?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colnago Retrofitting, scan NFC tag with smartphone to link to blockchain verification\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-jpg.webp 2003w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-1536x1022.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-768x511.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-tag-on-lugged-steel-frame-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago says their new Colnago Retrofitting program aims to combat counterfeiting, but also to add value and legitimacy for owners of vintage bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a guaranteed authentic mark of “the originality of the frame kit”, Colnago says it will give the bike added value on the resale market, especially bike collectors. It also adds more security in case of theft, as Colnago will be able to verify the bike’s ownership in case of any dispute. “<em>Once registered, it will be possible at any time to verify – by scanning the tag with a mobile phone – the model name and the certificate of originality issued by Colnago.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colnago Retrofitting – The cost of authentication</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-blockchain-scan-of-real-vintage-bike-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-blockchain-scan-of-real-vintage-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colnago Retrofitting road bike authenticity verification service, NFC tag linked to blockchain register\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-blockchain-scan-of-real-vintage-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-blockchain-scan-of-real-vintage-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-blockchain-scan-of-real-vintage-bike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-blockchain-scan-of-real-vintage-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Colnago-Retrofitting-road-bike-authenticity-verification-service_NFC-blockchain-scan-of-real-vintage-bike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago charges 29€ for their Retrofitting process to verify that your classic road bike is real. For that, you get the official Colnago Certificate of Authenticity, the NFC tag to stick onto your frame, and a carbon Colnago Owners Club card used to register your bike on the public blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also get the added bonus of special Colnago owner’s benefits, like preferred starting positions at some gran fondos &amp; historic cycling events and invitations to Colnago-hosted events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if it turns out that your garage-find Colnago is not, in fact, authentic? Well, Colnago will refund your 29€ as a consolation for learning that you’ve been riding a Faux-nago instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://colnago.com/retrofitting-service\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Colnago.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/colnago-retrofitting-wants-to-verify-the-authenticity-of-your-old-school-road-bike/\">Colnago Retrofitting Wants to Verify the Authenticity of Your Old School Road Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4bdd715ba0a7c75e892b73e14df41a90dd6fd592f78fe21b80fd592b723cbee1","category":"Cycling"}
