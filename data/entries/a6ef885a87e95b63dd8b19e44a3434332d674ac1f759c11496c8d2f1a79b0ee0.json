Below, we've highlighted the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features we know are still in development and that are slated for iOS 18.3 and iOS 18.4, updates coming in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Siri Features</h2>\r<br />\nApple is making some major changes to ‌Siri‌, and has outlined new functionality that will make ‌Siri‌ much more helpful. ‌Siri‌ will be able to learn more about you through your communications and actions on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, but this personal context won't be coming until sometime in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPersonal context will incorporate texts, emails, notes, and more, so you'll be able to ask ‌Siri‌ for things like a flight number buried in an email, or a recipe that a friend once texted you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Siri‌ will also be able to do more in apps, both first and third-party, with in-app actions. ‌Siri‌ will be able to do things like edit a photo for you and then send it to someone in the Messages app, or pull a PDF from an email and save it to the Files app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Siri‌ will also be able to get information and take action in third-party apps, doing things like getting a weather readout from Carrot Weather or scheduling an event in Fantastical.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew ‌Siri‌ capabilities will either come in iOS 18.3 or iOS 18.4 in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Sketch Style for Image Playground</h2>\r<br />\nAs of right now, ‌Image Playground‌ has two different styles to choose from, animation and illustration. There is a third, though, that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/apple-removes-sketch-from-image-playground/\">plans to add in the future</a>. Sketch is described as a \"highly detailed and academic\" style that \"produces gorgeous drawings on stark backgrounds.\" It is distinct from the illustration style that has strong outlines, bold colors, and simple shapes, and the animation style that has a \"whimsical, 3D cartoon look.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/image-wand-styles.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1289\" /><em><div>The animation, illustration, and sketch styles, respectively</div></em>\r<br />\nIf you want to see what the sketch style looks like, you can check it out in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-wand/\">Image Wand</a> feature in the Notes app, where it is available now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Genmoji on macOS</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 includes support for ‌Image Playground‌, but it does not have ‌Genmoji‌ integration as of yet. You can create ‌Genmoji‌ with iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2, but there is no Mac feature for making custom emoji characters. Apple plans to add it in a later update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Memory Movies on macOS</h2>\r<br />\nThe Memory Movie feature that lets you create slideshows from your photos using text descriptions is limited to the ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> in iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and later. It will come to ‌macOS Sequoia‌ in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Priority Notifications</h2>\r<br />\nApple is working on a feature that will show you your most important notifications first. Priority Notifications will show up at the top of your notification stack, but this option isn't live yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Languages</h2>\r<br />\nApple plans to add support for more languages in 2025, including Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Apple says that the first \"set\" of new languages will come in a software update in April (likely iOS 18.4), while more will come throughout the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Intelligence Support in the European Union</h2>\r<br />\nApple plans to start rolling out ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features to ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users in the European Union in April. EU users will officially get access to Writing Tools, ‌Genmoji‌, the updated ‌Siri‌ with better language understanding, ‌Siri‌ ChatGPT integration, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Intelligence Release Timing</h2>\r<br />\nWriting Tools, the new ‌Siri‌ design, Type to ‌Siri‌, notification summaries, smart replies, Clean Up in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and several other features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/\">launched in iOS 18.1</a>, which was released on Monday, October 28.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Image Playground‌, ‌Genmoji‌, ‌Siri‌ ChatGPT integration, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-releases-ios-18-2/\">and other features</a> were released in iOS 18.2, which launched on Wednesday, December 11. iOS 18.2 will be the last public iOS update of 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll other ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features are expected in iOS 18.3 and iOS 18.4, which will be released in 2025. iOS 18.3 could come as soon as late January, while iOS 18.4 will likely be an April update.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-intelligence-features-2025/\">These Apple Intelligence Features Aren't Coming Until 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-apple-intelligence-features-arent-coming-until-2025.2445128/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a6ef885a87e95b63dd8b19e44a3434332d674ac1f759c11496c8d2f1a79b0ee0","category":"Apple"}
