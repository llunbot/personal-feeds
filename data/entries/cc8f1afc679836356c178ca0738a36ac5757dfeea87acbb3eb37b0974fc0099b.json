First, back in October ’24, there was the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-new-abound-sr-short-rack-cargo-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Abound SR</a> (short rack) launch. Then, last month, we attended the launch of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-level-3-commuter-city-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Level 3</a> commuter. But that was <em>also</em> the launch of the brand new Abound LR (long rack) cargo eBike. The Abound LR has been embargoed until now, and I’ll tell you, the improvements made to the Abound LR from the previous generation are great!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-first-pic-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2023, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-abound-cargo-ebike-release/\" target=\"_blank\">Aventon introduced their first e-Cargo bike, the Abound</a>. This year, the Abound is splitting in two, with the Abound SR and LR. Those letters refer to Short Rack and Long Rack and correspond to the length of the bike. While the Abound SR is a compact bike that’s still cargo-capable, the Abound LR is the cargo bike with a full-size ‘bed’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Abound LR is a class 2 (pedal assist and throttle) eBike, that boasts a range of up to 60 miles. It comes with Aventon’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-new-abound-sr-short-rack-cargo-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">ACU technology</a> and can carry a whopping 440 lbs. It comes in two colors, Sage and Stealth.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Abound LR uses a Shengyi 36v, 750W hub drive motor. The Abound LR comes to a stop using hydraulic brakes and weighs in at 88 lbs. It uses a Shimano 8-speed Altus drivetrain, which is a big improvement from the previous Abound’s lackluster 7-speed drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review non-driveside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-non-driveside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame includes a sleek gravity-cast 6061 aluminum front triangle which gives the frame rigidity and a very low standover. The bike runs on 20 x 3.0″ tires, and smooths out the bumps with an included suspension seat post…more on this later.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review long rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-long-rack-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Full fenders and a solid rear rack</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review lockable frame bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-lockable-frame-bag-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Lockable frame. bag</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Included with the bike are rear footboards, front and rear fenders, a rear rack, and a lockable storage bag.

The group ride wasn’t very long, but there were some pretty steep hills in town, and the motor handled them with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review BMX style hbars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-BMX-style-hbars-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I have the previous version of the Abound, so I am not only familiar with this platform, but I think it’s a solid value. The new Abound LR is a vast improvement on what I thought was already a great cargo eBike. The first, and most notable change is eliminating the folding stem/cockpit. By eliminating the long, folding stem, the new Abound LR instantly feels more stable and less noodly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review quill stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-quill-stem-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new standard quill stem and BMX bars feel so solid in comparison. Using a quill stem with a long quill means that you can adjust the handlebar height easily. The BMX handlebar puts your hands in a comfortable and familiar spot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of a hub drive motor with six speed sensors, in combination with Aventon’s dual torque sensors, helps the bike feel predictable and accelerate more naturally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding a bike with a long wheelbase and small wheels takes a little getting used to, and this is the case on the Abound LR. But, that being said, once you get used to how it maneuvers, the bike rides and corners well. Braking is a non-issue with the Abound’s Tektro hydraulic brakes and the 180 and 203mm rotors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review display up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-display-up-close-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgraded display is small, sleek, and easy to read. Adjustments to your assist level and operating the turn signals are easy and intuitive. The throttle is out of the way but still easy to use and operate without taking your eyes off the road to find it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let’s Talk About The Seatpost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Abound LR comes with Aventon’s proprietary suspension seatpost. Now, before I get too critical about this, I have to say that the post does have a preload adjustment that I didn’t utilize before the ride, so I can’t speak to the adjustment of the post. Adjustment or not, I just don’t see the need for a suspension seat post on this particular cargo eBike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound LR Launch Review seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aventon-Abound-LR-Launch-Review-seatpost-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the seatpost on the Abound (and every Aventon I’ve ridden, sans the Ramblas) is just too short. I’m 6’1″, and usually ride their bikes with the post extended a little past the minimum insertion point, and still feel like I need a touch more post. This issue is the nature of the beast when making bikes that use “one-size-fits-most” geometry. And, it’s an issue that is easily resolved with a new, longer seat post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aventon’s new Abound LR is a great eCargo bike for a great price. At $2000, it packs a lot of value and versatility, making it easier for the eBike curious to check it out. It’s a well-thought-out bicycle with unique specs that feels safer and more solid than some other eCargo bikes I’ve ridden. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the Abound LR to anyone looking for a versatile, stout eCargo bike. It’s well built, well spec’d, and affordable. Get one so you can ride more and drive less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.aventon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aventon.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-aventon-abound-lr-cargo-ebike-review/\">The Affordable New Aventon Abound LR Cargo eBike is Loaded with Cool Features</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cc8f1afc679836356c178ca0738a36ac5757dfeea87acbb3eb37b0974fc0099b","category":"Cycling"}
