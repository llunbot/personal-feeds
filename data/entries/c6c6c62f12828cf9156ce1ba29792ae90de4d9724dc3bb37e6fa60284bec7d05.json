Gurman says it's \"possible\" that there will be speakers in the device's base, allowing it to serve as a HomePod-like device as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeyond this initial smart home device, Gurman has previously described a more ambitious product with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/\">larger screen mounted on a robotic arm</a> that would be able to identify users and automatically track them as they move around a room. That higher-end product will likely retail for around $1,000 and won't launch until 2026 at the earliest.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/\">Apple Smart Home Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/27/apple-smart-home-display-imac-g4-design/\">Apple's Smart Home Display to Resemble Iconic iMac G4 Design With Small Square Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-smart-home-display-to-resemble-iconic-imac-g4-design-with-small-square-display.2441071/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c6c6c62f12828cf9156ce1ba29792ae90de4d9724dc3bb37e6fa60284bec7d05","category":"Apple"}
