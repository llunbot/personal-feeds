Previous ESR stands have had CryoBoost, but the fan is now much quieter, which means there is hardly any reason to deactivate it–the fan can be turned on or off with the press of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15-watt MagSafe iPhone charger prominently displays the iPhone, making the charger ideal for a bedside table or desk—especially when flipped in Standby mode. However, the charger is in a fixed position and the angle can’t be adjusted. But if you have an iPhone that supports <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1972460/ios-17-standby-clock-widgets-photos-customize.html\">iOS 17’s StandBy</a> mode, the ESR stand works well. When charging an iPhone in 30 minutes, the battery gained 38 percent more battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second charging slot under the iPhone charger offers an output of 5 watts and is for AirPods and other headphone charging cases with an inductive charging function. We successfully charged the Soundcore Liberty 4 on the ESR stand.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ESR_25w3in1MagSafe_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ESR 25W 3-in-1 Ladestation für MagSafe \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ESR_25w3in1MagSafe_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ESR_25w3in1MagSafe_02.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ESR_25w3in1MagSafe_02.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ESR_25w3in1MagSafe_02.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ESR_25w3in1MagSafe_02.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ESR_25w3in1MagSafe_02.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Thomas Bergbold </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The third charging slot is certified for the Apple Watch and also charges with 5 watts of power. In 30 minutes, the ESR stand charged an Apple Watch Series 7 55 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ESR includes a USB-C power supply and a 5-foot (1.5-meter) USB-C cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the ESR 25W 3-in-1 Wireless Charger?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ESR does a lot of things right with the 25W 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with MagSafe and CryoBoost. Full compatibility through Apple certification, fast charging, and air cooling to protect the electronics. If there is something to criticize, it’s that the charging pads are not adjustable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/2084465/esr-25w-3-in-1-ladestation-magsafe-test.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2105469-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacWelt</a> and was translated by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\">Roman Loyola</a>.</em></p>\n\nMobile Phone Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4a560d90d57627d32380a524c76fe4ab96ff0be583a96ed1640e4faf9650cfda","category":"Apple"}
