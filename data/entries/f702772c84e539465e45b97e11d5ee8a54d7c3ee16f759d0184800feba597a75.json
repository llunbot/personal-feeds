In addition to previewing its rumored AR/VR headset, Apple is expected to announce a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/gurman-15-inch-macbook-air-wwdc/\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> and potentially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/new-mac-studio-likely-to-be-introduced-at-wwdc/\">updated Mac Studio models</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/wwdc-2023-apple-logo.jpeg\" alt width=\"2048\" height=\"1151\" />\r<br />\nApple routinely takes down its online store prior to launching new hardware, a move that helps to build anticipation.

Hardware announcements during last year's keynote included 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro models with the then-new M2 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollow along on MacRumors.com and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">@MacRumorsLive on Twitter</a> for full coverage of Apple's announcements throughout the day.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-store-down-ahead-of-wwdc/\">Apple Store Down Ahead of WWDC Today: New Macs and More Expected</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-down-ahead-of-wwdc-today-new-macs-and-more-expected.2391581/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f702772c84e539465e45b97e11d5ee8a54d7c3ee16f759d0184800feba597a75","category":"Apple"}
