There is a \"social layer\" that will allow the identities, avatars, and friends of users to move between virtual spaces on different devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Meta, multiple companies are working on devices that will use Meta Horizon OS. ASUS ROG is developing a performance gaming headset and Lenovo is working on mixed reality devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment. Meta says that it is also creating a limited edition version of Meta Quest in partnership with Xbox.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the expansion of Meta Horizon OS to third-party hardware manufacturers, Meta is making it easier for any developer to ship VR software on the platform by removing barriers between the Horizon Store and App Lab.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBy creating an operating system that can be used by other hardware manufacturers, Meta is inserting itself into the growing AR/VR ecosystem and creating opportunities for it to outpace Apple in mixed reality development. Apple launched the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, but software is lacking given the high price and limited distribution of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to a report from earlier today, interest in the Vision Pro is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/\">already waning</a> at Apple's retail locations with fewer people requesting demos.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/meta-expands-vr-operating-system/\">Meta Expands VR Operating System to Third-Party Hardware Makers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-expands-vr-operating-system-to-third-party-hardware-makers.2424702/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"89da43d9c4bd55589a6c6f3edebc95a6993b1a7cca672c325b25752179cfe660","category":"Apple"}
