{"title":"Limburg, home of the 2024 European Championships and cycling in Flanders","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/european-championships-limburg","date":1725639814000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/european-championships-limburg\">Limburg, home of the 2024 European Championships and cycling in Flanders</a></p>\n\n<p>Limburg in the Dutch corner of Flanders will host the 2024 UEC Road European Championships from 11th to 15th September, packing 14 events into five action-packed days, from the junior mixed time-trial to the women’s and men’s elite road race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the stars heading to Limburg are Netherlands’ Mischa Bredewold and France’s Christophe Laporte, both champing at the bit to defend their 2023 European title jerseys. But many have their eyes on thwarting this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course isn’t designed to suit just one type of rider, with countries bringing stacked fields of riders to give them multiple cards to play. As the host nation it’s no surprise to see a star-studded Netherlands roster including Dylan Groenewegen, Mathieu van der Poel, Lorena Wiebes and Shirin van Anrooij. But neighbours Belgium are set to derail the train with Jasper Philipsen and Tim Merlier, while France take Clara Copponi and Marie Le Net. Then there’s Italy, packing power in Jonathan Milan and Elisa Balsamo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders will endure the pain of repeated ascents of Limburg’s cobbled climbs from Heusden-Zolder to Hasselt, undertaking circuits within the race that will no doubt drain the energy from the legs of competitors. The women’s road race (9am on 14th September) is 162km and features 905m of elevation, while the men’s road race (12.30pm on 15th September) will take in 1,273m of climbing over 223km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both races follow the same course, an A-to-B route that links circuits in Hasselt and Limburg. First it’s one and a half laps of the Hasselt circuit for the women and three and a half laps for the men. The races then head south to the Limburg circuit, which includes the punishing Zammelenberg and Kolmontberg. The women will have to make two ascents of each, the men three, before their respective pelotons head back to the Hasselt circuit for the races’ climax, an all-out lap-and-a-half finishing dash in front of thousands of spectators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decisive moments look set to include the cobbles of Manshoven and Op de Kriezel on the Limburg circuit, which both come before the punchy bergs, and have the potential to fracture the races and create reduced sprint finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks set to be a stellar week, but the Limburg locale holds much more than just a single cycling event. Over the years it has evolved from a gritty mining town into a cycling destination rich in cobbled climbs, gravel trails and more than the odd hidden gem. Visitors should keep an eye out for the art installations that pop up across the region, as well as the many beautiful, tree-lined cycling routes such as Bekestraat in the nearby village of Eizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below we’ve compiled a list five of our favourite rides in Flanders, which along with dozens of other incredible routes, are all available with free GPX downloads from <a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">cyclinginflanders.cc</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ronde van Vlaanderen (Red loop)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/RVV-red-loop-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Visit Flanders / Cycling in Flanders</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Scale the Muur and feel like one of the professionals with this popular Tour of Flanders-inspired route</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jewel in the crown of the 115km <a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/routes/ronde-van-vlaanderen-red-loop\" target=\"_blank\">Ronde van Vlaanderen’s red loop</a> is getting the chance to take on the mythical Muur van Geraardsbergen. Nicknamed <em>‘The Wall’</em>, you don’t so much ride the Muur as scale it. Johan Museeuw, Peter van Petegem and Fabian Cancellara are just three who have used the 20% gradients up to the famed chapel as a gruelling springboard to glory in the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This route features 1,618m of elevation and takes you over the classic bergs of Greg van Avermaet’s beloved Berendries and Bosberg. The latter is the final climb of Omloop het Nieuwsblad, and often described as ‘Edwig Van Hooydonck Hill’ due to the Belgian attacking alongside the same lamppost to ride to glory in 1989 and 1991. Perhaps use this as inspiration on the 12% gradient near the Flemish Ardennes.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Download the<a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/routes/ronde-van-vlaanderen-red-loop\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>‘<a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/routes/ronde-van-vlaanderen-red-loop\" target=\"_blank\">Ronde van Vlaanderen (Red loop)</a>‘ route.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gent Wevelgem – In Flanders Fields</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-970x727.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/cycling-route-Gent-Wevelgem-20-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Visit Flanders / Cycling in Flanders</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This route is steeped in history, taking cyclists back in time by traversing First World War battlefields and finishing with the Kemmelberg</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/routes/gent-wevelgem-flanders-fields\" target=\"_blank\">Gent-Wevelgem – In Flanders Fields</a> plays a slight trick: the start isn’t in Gent and the finish isn’t in Wevelgem. Nonetheless, it is rich in its own DNA and regarded as ‘more than’ a race. Reflecting this is the recent addition of ‘In Flanders Fields’ to its name, in homage to its connections with multiple Great War battlefields, which are navigated both in the professional race and along this 84km route. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is history everywhere you look, with the route taking riders to the famous ‘plugstreets’ where, on the second of three gravel sections here, the 1914 Christmas Truce took place, the guns falling silent and soldiers from both sides coming together to exchange gifts and famously play a game of football.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 73km of riding comes the iconic Kemmelberg. The longest and steepest of the three ways up this climb features a maximum gradient over 20%, or a ‘kick in the teeth’ as many riders describe it, especially after already climbing 883m by that point over the course of the ride. Gravel might not be the first cycling-related thing you think of when ‘Flanders’ is mentioned, but gravel deviations for this route are also available for a new spin on an old Classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Download the ‘<a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/routes/low-hanging-fruit-limburg-gritgravelcc\" target=\"_blank\">Gent-Wevelgem – In Flanders Fields</a>‘ route.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Floubaix</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/221208_Cyclist_Flanders_0839-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Visit Flanders / Cycling in Flanders</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This two-for-one experience combines both the legendary Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix races for a Monument extraordinaire</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s better than riding one Monument? Riding two of them. Meet <a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/routes/floubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Floubaix</a>. Starting in Oudenaarde, Belgium, this 120km route takes on the Koppenberg – a short and sharp cobbled climb described as ‘the most difficult’ in the region with its soap-bar cobbles and 20% gradient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s Flanders’ longest cobbled climb in the famous Oude Kwaremont that captures our attention. This 2.1km stretch has a slight respite in the middle before rising once more, lulling the unwary into a false sense of security before a final sting in its tail. It might not possess the most severe gradients, but it’s the irregularity of the cobbles that makes the Kwaremont such a hard-earned inclusion on your palmarès. Just count yourself lucky you’re not riding over it three times like the pros do in the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From here the route segues fiendishly into the famed cobbles of Paris-Roubaix, and it’s time to embrace the chaos. This route includes the five-star Carrefour de l’Arbre <em>secteur</em> and a finish on the hallowed banks of the Roubaix velodrome. Open to the public all year round, this is the perfect – and only – place such an absurd route could finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Download the ‘<a href=\"https://www.cyclinginflanders.cc/routes/floubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Floubaix</a>‘ route.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Low Hanging Fruit in Limburg by gritgravel.cc</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/LowhangingfruitLimburg_Manshoven_cKramon.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Kramon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Where the charm of cycling meets the beauty of blossoms</em> <em>over European Championship cobbles</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haspengouw is somewhat of a hidden gem, the area producing a striking number of fruit orchids that blossom in the April and May months yet still provide a utopia all year round.

Limburg is easily accessible by train from most major cities. Train tickets and times are available on the <a href=\"https://www.belgiantrain.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">NMBS</a> website. Tickets for international train connections for those outside Belgium can be ordered on<a href=\"https://www.b-europe.com/EN\" target=\"_blank\"> b-europe</a>. Catch the Eurostar to Brussels, then it’s roughly a one-hour train ride from Brussels-Nord to Hasselt – the latter costs approximately £16.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>By car:</strong> Travelling by car between the UK to France and beyond (to Limburg) is easy via the Eurotunnel. There are no luggage restrictions, the ticket is for your vehicle, and up to nine people can travel on one ticket. The journey is under 35 minutes and prices vary, with a standard fare costing around £112 and a flexiplus ticket (no set crossing time) around £247. Buy tickets on the <a href=\"https://www.leshuttle.com/uk-en/tickets-fares-add-ons\" target=\"_blank\">Eurotunnel website</a>. It then takes 45 minutes to drive to Belgium from the Calais terminal, and three hours to Limburg. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>By bike:</strong> Limburg has 200km of paved and mostly car-free cycle paths. Online cycle route planners are available. You can take bikes on every train by buying an additional €4 ticket, no reservation needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>By bus:</strong> Bus routes can be found at <a href=\"https://www.delijn.be/en/\" target=\"_blank\">delijn.be</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flanders:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>By train:</strong> If travelling to Oudenaarde, the easiest option is to get a Eurostar train from a corresponding location such as London (tickets range from around £86 to £206 for standard class) to Brussels Midi. Bikes can be taken on <strong>specific services</strong> (so be sure to check with Eurostar). If travelling from London to Brussels, these bike-friendly trains depart at 09:01 (train 9116), 13:01 (train 9132) and 15:04 (train 9142) daily. Bikes cost £45 each way if booked more than 48 hours before departure or £60 each way if booked less than 48 hours before. You<strong> must email travelservices@eurostar.com</strong> to book a space for your bike, which must be fully assembled on trains travelling between London and Brussels. Passengers can also bring a folding bike, folding electric bike or children’s bike on board as long as it’s no longer than 85cm in length and carried in a protective bag that covers the whole bike. There are different rules for travelling between Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany, which can be found <a href=\"https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/travel-info/travel-planning/luggage/bikes\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Trains run by <a href=\"https://www.belgiantrain.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">SNCB</a> are then available for onwards travel from Brussels-Midi to Oudenaarde, which take 50 minutes and cost approximately £12.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>By car:</strong> Travelling via the Eurotunnel costs approximately £112 for a standard fare and £247 for a flexiplus fare (no set crossing time). Buy tickets on the <a href=\"https://www.leshuttle.com/uk-en/tickets-fares-add-ons\" target=\"_blank\">Eurotunnel website</a>. It then takes just under two hours to travel to Oudenaarde. Be aware that each Thursday from 6pm to 2pm there is a weekly market in the city centre (Grote Markt, Hoogstraat, Nederstraat) and this area isn’t accessible by car or bus. For information on travelling from Brussels, Ghent and Kortrijk, more can be found <a href=\"https://www.oudenaarde.be/en/tourism/plan-your-trip/mobility/getting-there\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Elsewhere, low emission zones have been introduced in Antwerp, Ghent and Brussels to improve air quality.

The <a href=\"https://bikeontrain.belgiantrain.be/en/\" target=\"_blank\">BikeOnTrain travel planner</a> can tell you which trains are best equipped. For bikes on the Eurotunnel, it costs £50 per bicycle via a shuttle service and a minimum of 10 working days advanced booking is required. You can find more information on the <a href=\"https://www.leshuttle.com/uk-en/travelling-with-us/travelling-with-different-vehicles/bicycles\" target=\"_blank\">Le Shuttle website</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>By bus: </strong>More information on buses can be found at <a href=\"https://www.delijn.be/en/?vertaling=true\" target=\"_blank\">De Lijn</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-cobbles-classics-cycling\">Big Ride: A one day Classic in Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-roubaix-cycling\">Big Ride: Flanders vs Roubaix</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-cobbled-climbs-flanders\">The best cobbled climbs in Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/european-championships-limburg\">Limburg, home of the 2024 European Championships and cycling in Flanders</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8fb2eb3663af0b49612d8af0cd5385bbd81c04e03ec770d8f93dde68acac75b2","category":"Cycling"}
