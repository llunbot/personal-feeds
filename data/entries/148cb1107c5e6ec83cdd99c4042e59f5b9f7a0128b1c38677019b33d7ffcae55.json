As we wrote at the announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]here was nothing quite like the originals, which were PC games first and foremost ... There was a purity to those games that's lost in the general, well, EA-ness of the reboots.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And, lo, was there much rejoicing when <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection\"><em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em></a> arrived? There was not. Reviews of the $35 package are <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446550/STAR_WARS_Battlefront_Classic_Collection/\">\"Mostly Negative\" on Steam</a> as this is written, with roughly 20 percent of reviews positive. Players are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1beg0dn/report_everything_even_if_you_refund/\">reporting numerous bugs</a>Â and (rightfully, we might suggest) complaining about the lack of an option to invert joystick axes. There's also a lack of aim assist for console players, which typically helps round out their relative disadvantage to PC players using a mouse and keyboard.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010236#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010236&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"148cb1107c5e6ec83cdd99c4042e59f5b9f7a0128b1c38677019b33d7ffcae55","category":"Tech"}
