Each material was chosen for its ability to minimize environmental impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Algae in the Tread: Sourced from algae blooms to restore aquatic ecosystems, preventing eutrophication and methane release.</li>\n<li>Recycled Para-Aramid in the Beads and Puncture Protection: Utilised from used body armor in a closed-loop recycling process, incorporating renewable carbon and reducing waste.</li>\n<li>Post-Consumer Recyclate (PCR): Sourced from local waste streams with a low CO2-equivalent (Kg CO2-eq).</li>\n<li>Recycled Fish Nets for the Casing: Collected from the ocean, reducing emissions by 49% and energy use by 15%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img width=\"5535\" height=\"3376\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Sustainable-Tyres-.jpg?fit=1200,3376&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Sustainable-Tyres-.jpg?w=5535&amp;quality=75 5535w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Sustainable-Tyres-.jpg?resize=1200,732&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Sustainable-Tyres-.jpg?resize=2000,1220&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Sustainable-Tyres-.jpg?resize=768,468&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Sustainable-Tyres-.jpg?resize=1536,937&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Sustainable-Tyres-.jpg?resize=2048,1249&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The brand has developed tires for bikes, e-bikes, kids’ bikes, wheelchairs, cargo trailers, and more.
