{"title":"Apple to Start Selling All 24-Inch iMac Colors in Retail Stores","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-retail-stores-to-sell-all-imac-colors/","date":1631301466000,"content":"We're not expecting new Macs to debut at Apple's upcoming \"California Streaming\" event, but according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436404979250565120\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is making one small tweak to its Mac sales plans.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/m1-imac.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the September 14 event, Apple retail stores will begin selling the 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> in all colors, which will mean all seven colors will be able to be purchased in store.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Apple's retail stores only offer the ‌iMac‌ in green, pink, blue, and silver. The yellow, orange, and purple colors cannot be purchased in stores and must be ordered online.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe change will make it easier for customers who want one of the more unusual ‌iMac‌ colors to get an ‌iMac‌ right away without having to wait for shipping. It may also mean that third-party stores will be able to carry additional colors, as retailers like Best Buy have also been limited to green, pink, blue, and silver.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are highly anticipated redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that are in the works, but unfortunately, we are not expecting these new machines at the September event. Instead, Apple will likely hold a second October and/or November event that will focus on Macs and iPads.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-retail-stores-to-sell-all-imac-colors/\">Apple to Start Selling All 24-Inch iMac Colors in Retail Stores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-start-selling-all-24-inch-imac-colors-in-retail-stores.2310307/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lez-R3MwOHY:LhSg6HGAAtM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lez-R3MwOHY:LhSg6HGAAtM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lez-R3MwOHY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fd9bc79a3640da2b16d05cc7086acc17e554cab90f424e17492e158c772add71","category":"Apple"}
