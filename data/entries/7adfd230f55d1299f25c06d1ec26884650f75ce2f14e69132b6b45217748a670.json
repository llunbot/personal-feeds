The Glowtime event will kick off at 10am PT Monday with a video keynote that introduces the biggest new products of the fall: the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a>. And there may be a few surprises along the way as well, including <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">new AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">an iPad mini</a>, and maybe even “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2446617/apple-event-keynote-moments-that-changed-everything.html\">One more thing</a>.” Here’s everything you need to know about the big show.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Glowtime event: What’s coming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 16 and 16 Plus:</strong> Apple’s base-level iPhones are expected to get a host of new features, including the iPhone 15 Pro’s Action button, a new Capture button, an A18 processor, Apple Intelligence, and a new vertical camera alignment. And of course, some new colors too that are noticeably brighter than last year’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max:</strong> The high-end phones get larger screens (6.32 inches and 6.9 inches), a faster chip (A18 Pro), and better cameras. And the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s enhanced zoom lens should be coming to the smaller model as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Series 10:</strong> The Glowtime event is being held on September 10, exactly 10 years after the Apple Watch made its debut at the iPhone 6 event, so it’s no secret that Apple is planning one of the biggest updates ever. Rumors say the first ever redesign could be on the way, with larger screens, a thinner body, and flatter edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch SE 3:</strong> After four years of basically the same watch, the 3rd-gen SE looks to be a major overhaul, with a plastic body and a lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 3:</strong> Not much new is expected other than a new chip and maybe a second color option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods:</strong> All of Apple’s AirPods are long overdue for an update and several are candidates for this event. A new budget model could replace the ancient 2nd-gen model with a lower price; a 4th-gen update could bring noise-cancellation and a new design; and an AirPods Max refresh could also be on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad mini: </strong>Not much new is expected from the next mini update other than a new chip and more RAM to make it Apple Intelligence-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Glowtime event: How to watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can watch the keynote live on Apple.com or the TV app, or just watch the embedded YouTube video stream below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Glowtime event: Live blog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the event kicks off, we’ll be updating live as everything is announced. In the meantime, stay tuned for any news and rumors we get ahead of the event:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Store Scandinavia grand opening:</strong> Apple has announced that its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/se/retail/mallofscandinavia/\" target=\"_blank\">newest store in the Mall of Scandinavia</a> will have its grand opening on Friday, September 20, a strong indication that the iPhone 16 will launch on that day.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7adfd230f55d1299f25c06d1ec26884650f75ce2f14e69132b6b45217748a670","category":"Apple"}
