The company <a href=\"https://ipsw.dev/signing/?identifier=iPad16%2C5\">has stopped signing</a> the update for these iPads, meaning it will no longer be offered to users when they check, and Apple's servers won't activate the update if it's installed some other way.</p>\n<p>Apple confirmed to Ars that it had \"temporarily removed\" the update in order to \"resolve an issue that is impacting a small number of devices.\"</p>\n\n<p>The update has supposedly been \"bricking\" devices for some M4 iPad Pro users; anecdotal reports from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS/comments/1figlrs/ipados_18_bricked_my_m4_ipad/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-ipados-18-for-m4-ipad-pro-after-bricking-complaints.2436726/\">MacRumors forum users</a> suggest that some users have installed the update without issue, and others have ended up with unresponsive devices. Apple is apparently offering hardware replacements to users who have been affected, which points to a pretty serious bug—usually devices can be put into recovery (or DFU) mode as a last resort in the event of a botched software update.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050551#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050551&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5b1c695ed9abec10892e933ad04b292d4b13f02d5171d4b7152eabafd315529","category":"Tech"}
