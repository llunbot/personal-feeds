Trump was indicted on Tuesday in\nconnection with his widespread efforts to overturn the 2020\nelection following a sprawling federal investigation into his\nattempts to cling to power after losing the presidency to Joseph\nR. Biden Jr.</p>\n\n<p>The indictment was filed by the special counsel Jack Smith in\nFederal District Court in Washington. It accuses Mr. Trump of\nthree conspiracies: one to defraud the United States, a second to\nobstruct an official government proceeding and a third to deprive\npeople of civil rights provided by federal law or the\nConstitution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can you even believe it? Well, other than the fact that we watched him do all of this live on television, repeatedly over the course of his final months in office, can you believe it? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/01/us/trump-jan-6-indictment-2020-election.html\">Read the full indictment here</a>. It opens thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Defendant, DONALD J. TRUMP, was the forty-fifth President of\nthe United States and a candidate for re-election in 2020. The\nDefendant lost the 2020 presidential election.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The indictment, poetically, is 45 pages long.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/01/trump-indicted-jan-6\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f9713e8a56db8888cea2ad20261c6c5df7f224c8dc47fd6bdccc0fc3e0c55f46","category":"Tech"}
