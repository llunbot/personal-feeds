Searches can be initiated based on what you ask or by clicking on the web search icon in the ChatGPT interface. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith ChatGPT Search, you can ask a question using conversational language and get web information, along with more details through follow-up questions. ChatGPT maintains context, so the entire conversation can be used to get a tailored answer to a query.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOpenAI has partnered with news and data providers to offer up-to-date information for categories like weather, stocks, sports, news, and maps. Searches with ChatGPT include links to sources, while a sources button below the response provides a sidebar with all of the references used.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA recent ChatGPT search update gives it a more traditional search engine feel, displaying a map, images of local attractions, and brief descriptions for each result.
