It also includes extended context windows for processing longer texts, encryption, enterprise-grade security and privacy, and group account management features.</p>\n\n<p>Building on the success of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">ChatGPT</a>, which launched just nine months ago, the enterprise version of the popular chatbot seeks to ease minds and broaden capabilities.</p>\n<p>Among its perks: a 32,000 token context window, which means it can process more text (or hold longer conversations) at once. Tokens are fragments of a word, and 32,000 tokens are roughly equivalent to about 24,000 words. Currently, ChatGPT with GPT-4 maxes out at 8,000 tokens for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/\">ChatGPT Plus</a> users. Also, no more usage limits: Enterprise customers will have access to unlimited GPT-4 queries at a faster speed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963799#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963799&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"868c04a240878d58c84cd96f58f77eb58095f945a0cfe3b2d68dd7ba5efef372","category":"Tech"}
