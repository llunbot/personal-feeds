The JEFFSY CORE range’s four build options have been revised and now include carbon or aluminum frame options for the mid-spec models. The highest-end model sticks with a carbon frame and the entry-level bike is available in aluminum only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YT now equips the JEFFSYs with Hayes Dominion A4 disc brakes on all but the base model, options for SRAM T-Type drivetrains, and carbon wheels on the highest-end CORE 4 bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>YT JEFFSY Key Specs:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-side-forest.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-side-forest.webp\" alt=\"YT JEFFSY, side, forest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-side-forest.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-side-forest-297x181.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-side-forest-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-side-forest-768x467.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The JEFFSY is a trail-focused MTB, designed to offer balanced capabilities on both climbs and descents. This mid-travel rig offers 145mms of rear travel, controlled by YT’s V4L linkage. 150mm forks are stocked on all models, but the frame can run a 160mm fork. The JEFFSY CORE bikes roll on 29” wheels, and YT makes no mention of MX compatibility for these models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Stash-storage-compartment.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Stash-storage-compartment.webp\" alt=\"YT JEFFSY, Stash frame storage compartment\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Stash-storage-compartment.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Stash-storage-compartment-297x153.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Stash-storage-compartment-120x62.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Stash-storage-compartment-768x395.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest JEFFSY carbon frames include STASH downtube storage, plus an accessory mount on the underside of the top tube. The compartment’s storage lid is double-sealed for water resistance and to keep things quiet. Aluminum models do not get in-frame storage, but they do include the top tube accessory mount for on-bike tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-SRAM-XO-T-Type-derailleur.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-SRAM-XO-T-Type-derailleur.webp\" alt=\"YT JEFFSY, T-Type derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-SRAM-XO-T-Type-derailleur.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-SRAM-XO-T-Type-derailleur-297x153.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-SRAM-XO-T-Type-derailleur-120x62.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-SRAM-XO-T-Type-derailleur-768x395.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for fitments the JEFFSY frame offers UDH derailleur hangers and runs Boost 148mm rear axles. Bottom brackets are PF92 on carbon frames, while the aluminum models use BSA threaded BBs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A range of 125-230mm dropper posts are stocked between the different frame sizes (except the CORE 1 which tops out at a 200mm post). All models get YT’s Postman V2 dropper post with adjustable travel and a 31.6mm diameter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Core-1-AL-rear-angle.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Core-1-AL-rear-angle.webp\" alt=\"YT JEFFSY CORE 1 AL, rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Core-1-AL-rear-angle.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Core-1-AL-rear-angle-297x181.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Core-1-AL-rear-angle-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-Core-1-AL-rear-angle-768x467.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All JEFFSY frames feature a water bottle mount on the down tube just above the BB. This mount can host YT’s 620ml Thirstmaster 6000 bottle with its side-loading cage. Both carbon and aluminum frames feature internal cable routing through the front triangle, plus chainstay and lower down tube protectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>JEFFSY frames are available in five sizes from small to XXL. This range should cover riders from 5’0” to 6’8”. A flip-chip in the frame offers High and Low geometry settings… check out the chart to see the differences between the two settings and all figures not highlighted below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-geo-chart-lrg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"883\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-geo-chart-lrg.webp\" alt=\"YT JEFFSY geo chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-geo-chart-lrg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-geo-chart-lrg-297x219.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-geo-chart-lrg-120x88.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YT-Jeffsy-geo-chart-lrg-768x565.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the High position, the JEFFSY has a 65.6° head angle. The seat mast angles range from 77.5 – 79.2° depending on frame size. In Low, the steering angle drops to 65° and the seat masts slack out to between 76.9 – 78.6°. Reach numbers are not pushing boundaries, with a medium frame coming in at 455mm (Low) or 462mm (High) and a large measuring 475/481mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YT offers two different chainstay lengths across the size range. S-M-L frames get rear ends measuring 435mm (High) or 437mm (Low). L-XXL frames get 440mm (High) or 442mm (Low) chainstays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For complete build specs on each model check out YT’s website.
