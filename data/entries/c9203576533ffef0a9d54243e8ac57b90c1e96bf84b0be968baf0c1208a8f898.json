The first you’ll know of it is when you come to switch or replace your tyres, finding little solid noodles of sealant on the reverse side of the tyre’s carcass indicating the scene of the crime. In some cases, you’ll find a thorn or shard of flint still embedded in your tyre, but completely sealed by the sealant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At other times, it’s likely you will notice a tubeless puncture, usually from the sound of air escaping your tyre, a spaff of tubeless sealant (good luck washing that out) or loss of tyre pressure, but it is still possible to plug the hole using only sealant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give your sealant its best chance, spin and angle your wheel so that the hole is close to the ground, allowing gravity to help the sealant flow to the affected area. If it doesn’t seal, bubbling and hissing continuously, that’s when you might have to consider tubeless puncture repair.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Simple tubeless punctures</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tubeless repair tools\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01519.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how good your tubeless sealant is, sometimes it needs a little helping hand. Enter stage left, the tubeless plug. This can take several forms, including the popular and cost-effective rubber worm/bacon strip/anchovy (delete as appropriate), or more intricate designs such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike-upgrades\" target=\"_blank\">Stan’s Dart</a> or Dynaplug. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just the same sort of tech that you’ll find for repairing holes in motorcycle and car tyres, scaled down. Fear not if you find yourself on a high alpine pass without any supplies; a passing motorbike tourer may just be able to help you out!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each type of plug kit will come with instructions on how to use them, but in short, you’ll need to stab into the tyre first to ream the hole, if a reamer is included. Then attach the plug to the tool, pushing into the tyre carefully; you neither want to damage your rim tape nor push the whole plug all the way through onto the inside of the tyre. Then remove the tool carefully, leaving the plug in situ, which you can then trim down carefully if you wish. (Trimming is recommended, as a trailing plug can do a surprising amount of damage to paintwork.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The dreaded sidewall slash</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tubeless repair tools\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01560.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re unlucky, you might slash a sidewall while riding, especially over rougher terrain featuring sharp rock such as flint. Unfortunately, no size of tubeless plug can help you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The go-to trailside fix for a slashed tyre is to insert a tyre boot to cover the affected area, and then insert an inner tube. The tyre boot can be made of all sorts of materials – a piece of old inner tube, part of a toothpaste tube, a railcard or fiver have all been known to work – or you can buy a dedicated boot from brands such as Park Tool or Restrap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boot sits on the inside of the tyre and essentially stops the inner tube from protruding out of the side of the tyre through the hole, though is very much a ‘<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/what-to-take-on-a-bike-ride\" target=\"_blank\">get-you-home</a>’ fix rather than anything more permanent. Unfortunately for you and your wallet, if you slash a sidewall, you’ll need to replace the tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pinch punctures, or snakebites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s one last type of tubeless puncture that you need to be aware of, and it’s one that may just surprise you. If you thought pinch punctures were only for inner tubes, think again! If you run tyre pressures on the softer side and tackle rockier, rougher trails, it is in fact possible to puncture through your tyre using the rim. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of puncture is often referred to as a snakebite as you’ll end up with not just one, but a pair of punctures. More often than not, at least one of these holes will be really close to the bead of the tyre, which is almost always game over for the tyre. You may well be able to plug it, carefully, though it’s highly recommended that you then replace the tyre before your next ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moral of the story is, there is such thing as <em>too</em> low <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\" target=\"_blank\">tyre pressure</a> when it comes to tubeless setups, and running pressures that are too low, for example after a puncture, can be equally risky! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What tools do you need for tubeless tyre repair?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tubeless repair tools\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the plugs themselves, you’ll need a dedicated tool to help install them. For most, this looks like a thick sewing needle with an open-ended ‘eye’. This allows you to insert the plug into the tyre and remove the tool without pulling the plug back out again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are variations on this design of course, with different tools for more specialist systems. Some also have a separate or integrated reaming or rasp tool, to help prepare the tyre’s hole for the plug. Some tyre repair kits also include a small blade, allowing you to trim down the excess external part of the inserted plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As these tools tend to be rather pointy, you’ll usually find them supplied in a metal capsule, pouch or plastic kit to limit potential damage should the worst happen and you find yourself getting a little overfamiliar with the road or trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With tubeless tyre setups becoming more common, some brands such as Topeak and Crankbrothers have designed multitools to include these tools, which means one less thing to carry if you’ve got limited pocket or bag real estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I still need to carry an inner tube?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Eclipse bicycle inner tubes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-13.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Alas yes, there are still times when even the best tubeless repair tools can’t quite seal a nasty puncture.

Both of the ends of the machined aluminium tool can be removed to reveal four tubeless plugs; three standard and one thicker ‘megaplug’ for larger punctures, all housed in stainless steel shafts that screw into the tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other tubeless plugs, these feature pointed brass or aluminium bullet tips, which help to pierce through the tyre at the site of puncture without having to prepare with a reaming tool first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the plugs are pre-loaded into the tool, this also means that you don’t need to prepare a plug with a pronged insertion tool before acting on the tyre either. Simply remove the end cap, stab into the tyre and pull the tool back as the plug is left in place to seal the hole. Not only does this simplify proceedings, but it can also help you to seal the puncture quicker, meaning less time at the side of the road pumping back up to the right tyre pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to buy replacement plug packs from Dynaplug, with a set of five standard plugs costing £8.99, or £9.99 for three of the larger plugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/dynaplug-racer-tubeless-tyre-plug-review\" target=\"_blank\">Dynaplug Racer Tubeless Tyre Plug review </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Park Tool Tubeless Tyre Plug Tool TPT-1</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/DSC01381.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>£44.99 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20283&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fpark-tool-tpt-1-tubeless-tyre-plug-tool-qktpt1\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alloy tubeless plug insertion tool in plastic storage case</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Five thick plugs included</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>79g including plugs</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Park Tool’s TPT-1 tubeless tyre plug tool features an ergonomic anodised alloy handle on the insertion tool.
