It is yet another sign that next-generation CarPlay might finally be nearing launch, after a few <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/ios-18-2-beta-next-generation-carplay-icons/\">redesigned icons for the system showed up in iOS 18.2 beta code</a> earlier this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><em>Porsche's preview of next-generation CarPlay from December 2023</em></div>\r<br />\nThe images show various next-generation CarPlay instrument cluster and interface designs, including a few with what appears to be the logo for German automaker Audi. When it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/\">first previewed next-generation CarPlay</a> in June 2022, Apple said Audi was committed to offering it, but the automaker has yet to confirm any specific plans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Next-Generation-CarPlay-EU-Image-Filings.jpg\" width=\"7766\" height=\"3749\" /><em>A few of the next-generation CarPlay images filed in the EU</em></div>\r<br />\nThe database entries were discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/\">Aaron Perris</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has already shown off what next-generation CarPlay looks like several times, so the images do not show anything we have not seen before, but the timing of the filings is notable. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/\">Apple's website</a> continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay support will \"arrive in 2024,\" but it has yet to provide a more specific timeframe. Aston Martin and Porsche <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/\">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> in December 2023, but neither automaker has released any vehicles with support yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith just over a month left in the year, some are beginning to wonder if Apple will still meet its stated 2024 timeframe for next-generation CarPlay. So, it is reassuring that Apple is still working towards a launch behind the scenes.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/next-generation-carplay-images-in-eu/\">Next-Generation CarPlay Images With Audi Logo Appear in EU Database</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-carplay-images-with-audi-logo-appear-in-eu-database.2443980/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bfe7e57ea53bc89a9ecb9f1176491db12cd664395d0b4cc42e70be4563c92a94","category":"Apple"}
