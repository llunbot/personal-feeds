What’s not to like? <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a> shares the latest evolution in his min-max approach to kitting up for a ride with a supplement-rich drink mix <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/bike-hacks/\">Bike Hack.</a></em><span></span></p>\n<p>About a year ago, I wrote <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tailwind-endurance-fuel-review/\" target=\"_blank\">a review of Tailwind Endurance Fuel.</a> And the review was <i>fine</i>, but I’m not an expert on nutrition and fitness like I am on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/how-to-use-mtb-suspension-volume-spacers/\" target=\"_blank\">suspension</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/measuring-mtb-seat-tube-angles/\">geometry</a>. So, I spoke at length with Tailwind’s co-founder Jeff Vierling, and he helped me break down <a href=\"https://tailwindnutrition.com/pages/science\" target=\"_blank\">exactly why I like the stuff so damn much.</a> Tailwind is calorie-dense, easy to digest, and very efficient. If I’m planning an ambitious all-day ride where success is not guaranteed, I’ll often rely on nothing but a good breakfast, frequent water stops, and a Tony-Montana-sized mountain of Tailwind powder.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-9.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I kinda do need a mountain of this stuff to sustain myself through a big ride. It takes me probably an hour and a half to go through each single-serving packet, and each packet is about the volume of a Snickers bar. Plus, they cost $2.50. That’s why I opt for the bulk package, which gets you almost 3X the bang for your buck. And drink mix is significantly more compact when it’s all compressed into one mass. At first, I carried it in a burly reusable Ziplock-style bag that was the right shape and size to bring on a one-day epic or a two-day romp. But it was never that convenient. It wasn’t easy to pour, and the seal would sometimes clog. So, I came up with something better. Something I guess technically counts as a drink mix bike hack…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There are a bunch of different sized “soft flasks” on the market, ranging from over a gallon to as small as five ounces. I reckon the latter is for small children or ultralight runners, but before I found Tailwind, I used them to carry several servings of bulk-packaged energy gel. I got tired of the mess, but that experience inspired me to try those pouches for carrying dry drink mix. They’re pretty perfect. They’ll fold down as you empty them, and you can start with whichever size best suits a given ride. I’ve got one that’s just under 12 fluid ounces, which holds about six servings of Tailwind. Or, for big two- to three-day rides, I repurposed the one-liter bladder from my Katadyn BeFree filter after it developed a pinhole leak. Bonus hack: If you email Katadyn that your bladder is leaking, they’ll send you a new one for free.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Most soft-flask caps will have some sort of nozzle. They don’t get in the way, but I’m on the lookout for a regular cap with the right diameter and thread pitch. Either way, I’ve never had either these containers open unexpectedly in my pack, and have never had their contents contaminated with water on wet days. They’re durable enough to rattle around in a frame bag or backpack, but I found the smaller pouch fits in a some of my favorite easy-to-access spots. This 12-ounce model is, of course, about the size of a pop can. If you’ve ever tried to cram a road soda in a pack’s hip pocket, you’ll find they often fit perfectly. Add the flexibility of a soft flask, and you’ll find they’re also quite well suited for jersey pockets, or my favorite, the minimalist race-belt hip pack.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>And most importantly, they’re easy to use, though not quite as easy as dumping an entire single serving into a bottle. It’s always a bit of a guessing game whether I’m pouring the right amount into my bottle, but it doesn’t really matter. I’m not making sourdough here. It’s fine if there’s too much or too little mix in the mix. Plus, I have several fewer pieces of disposable packaging to keep track of on a ride.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/radavistbike-hacks-bike-bulk-drink-mix-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This got me thinking about other bulk consumables that could replace the single-use approach. I already transfer my chain lube from a gallon jug into an old Tri-Flow bottle. I wonder if Cliff Bar would ever sell just a giant block of Crunchy Peanut Butter that I could chop apart and carry in a sandwich tin … But that’s less of a bike hack, and more a topic for a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/wish-list/\">Wish List.</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-hacks-cheap-easy-bulk-drink-mix/\">Bike Hacks: The Cheaper, Easier Way To Carry Powdered Drink Mix</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"960beafd96ba975d68b5eef95999441f350f6305373a364c7ac3a5b28b18ddf5","category":"Cycling"}
