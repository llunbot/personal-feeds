If Cue is telling people that, that means a lot. No executive at Apple is more juiced-in company-wide than Cue. Cook’s first action as CEO <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2011/09/01/itunes-chief-eddy-cue-gets-promoted-to-senior-vice-president-of-internet-software-and-services/\">was to promote Cue</a>, and Cue was arguably just as tight with and trusted by Steve Jobs.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/08/ternus-gurman\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"19d7108b8f2ef6988533462412da4ee63f346e7886dd05ed22172c4ea4877ac1","category":"Tech"}
