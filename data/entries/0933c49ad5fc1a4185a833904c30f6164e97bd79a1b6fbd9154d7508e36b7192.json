Until now, it was not available for cellular conversations, with Apple offering no way to improve call quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn a ‌FaceTime‌ call, Voice Isolation can be enabled by activating control center, tapping on the Mic Mode option, and choosing the Voice Isolation option, so the feature may be able to be activated in a similar way for voice calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther iOS 16.4 features include new emojis, Push Notifications for web apps, bug fixes for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, Crash Detection optimizations, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/ios-16-4-voice-isolation-phone-calls/\">iOS 16.4 Adds Voice Isolation for Cellular Phone Calls</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-16-4-adds-voice-isolation-for-cellular-phone-calls.2384350/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0933c49ad5fc1a4185a833904c30f6164e97bd79a1b6fbd9154d7508e36b7192","category":"Apple"}
