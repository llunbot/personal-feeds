Earlier this year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/\">extended its 5G modem supply agreement with Qualcomm</a> for iPhone launches through 2026, so Apple still has plenty of time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/\">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019, as part of its efforts to design its own 5G chip. It is unclear if Apple's chip would have any consumer benefits over Qualcomm's modems, but it would reduce Apple's reliance on Qualcomm. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/\">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> over alleged anticompetitive practices and $1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">settled the lawsuit</a> in 2019.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/kuo-apple-5g-modem-rollout-begins-2025/\">Kuo: Apple's 5G Modem to Rapidly Roll Out in iPhones Starting Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apples-5g-modem-to-rapidly-roll-out-in-iphones-starting-next-year.2435231/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5288678b39e2c78ef3fa8ceeb6ef1f355e74d12c35d1334a9fd81dd0d6626a0d","category":"Apple"}
