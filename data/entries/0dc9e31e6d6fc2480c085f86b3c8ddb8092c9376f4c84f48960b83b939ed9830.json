The Europa Clipper mission should reach Europa around April of 2030. If it collects data hinting at the moon’s potential habitability, robotic lander missions could be the only way to confirm if there’s really life in there or not.</p>\n<p>To make these lander missions happen, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory team has been working on a robot that could handle the search for life and already tested it on the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. “At this point this is a pretty mature concept,” says Kevin Hand, a planetary scientist at JPL who led this effort.</p>\n<h2>Into the unknown</h2>\n<p>There are only a few things we know for sure about conditions on the surface of Europa, and nearly all of them don’t bode well for lander missions. First, Europa is exposed to very harsh radiation, which is a problem for electronics. The window of visibility—when a potential robotic lander could contact Earth—lasts less than half of the 85 hours it takes for the moon to complete its day-night cycle due to the Europa-Jupiter orbit. So, for more than half the mission, the robot would need to fend for itself, with no human ground teams to get it out of trouble. The lander would also need to run on non-rechargeable batteries, because the vast distance to the Sun would make solar panels prohibitively massive.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/nasa-robot-for-drilling-on-icy-moons-tested-on-alaskan-glacier/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/nasa-robot-for-drilling-on-icy-moons-tested-on-alaskan-glacier/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0dc9e31e6d6fc2480c085f86b3c8ddb8092c9376f4c84f48960b83b939ed9830","category":"Tech"}
