Unknown attackers have been exploiting a 5-year-old vulnerability since March. The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-7029, is easy to exploit and allows attackers to execute malicious code. The AVM1203 is no longer sold or supported, so no update is available to fix the critical zero-day.</p>\n<h2>That time a ragtag army shook the Internet</h2>\n<p>Akamai said that the attackers are exploiting the vulnerability so they can install a variant of Mirai, which arrived in September 2016 when a botnet of infected devices <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/why-the-silencing-of-krebsonsecurity-opens-a-troubling-chapter-for-the-net/\">took down</a> cybersecurity news site Krebs on Security. Mirai contained functionality that allowed a ragtag army of compromised webcams, routers, and other types of IoT devices to wage distributed denial-of-service attacks of record-setting sizes. In the weeks that followed, the Mirai botnet delivered similar attacks on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/botnet-of-145k-cameras-reportedly-deliver-internets-biggest-ddos-ever/\">Internet service providers</a> and other targets. One such attack, against dynamic domain name provider Dyn <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/double-dip-internet-of-things-botnet-attack-felt-across-the-internet/\">paralyzed</a> vast swaths of the Internet.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046043#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046043&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e43872c41519c05050007d5559bf047e66c881c5ff0db85e6e4887b074adf94","category":"Tech"}
