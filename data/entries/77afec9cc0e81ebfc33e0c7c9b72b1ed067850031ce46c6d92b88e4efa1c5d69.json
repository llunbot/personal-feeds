The <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.55129/gov.uscourts.ca2.55129.232.0.pdf\">ruling</a> is a loss for six trade groups that represent ISPs, although it isn't clear right now whether the law will be enforced.</p>\n<p>New York's Affordable Broadband Act (ABA) was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ny-cant-force-isps-to-offer-15-low-income-broadband-plans-judge-rules/\">blocked</a> in June 2021 by a US District Court judge who ruled that the state law is rate regulation and preempted by federal law. Today, the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit reversed the ruling and vacated the permanent injunction that barred enforcement of the state law.</p>\n<p>For consumers who qualify for means-tested government benefits, the state law requires ISPs to offer \"broadband at no more than $15 per month for service of 25Mbps, or $20 per month for high-speed service of 200Mbps,\" the ruling noted. The law allows for price increases every few years and makes exemptions available to ISPs with fewer than 20,000 customers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020332#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020332&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77afec9cc0e81ebfc33e0c7c9b72b1ed067850031ce46c6d92b88e4efa1c5d69","category":"Tech"}
