While punishing tariffs of 125 percent remain on imports from China,  Apple could receive a much-needed exemption based on a vague but promising comment from President Trump in a press conference Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2660512/president-trump-us-tariffs-impact-apple-products-price.html\">hit harder</a> than most by the situation because its supply chain is so dependent on Chinese manufacturing. We’ve <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2660512/president-trump-us-tariffs-impact-apple-products-price.html\">written extensively</a> about how Apple can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2661902/how-apple-can-handle-trumps-tariffs-without-raising-prices-too-much.html\">handle the tariffs</a> without raising prices too much, but the company’s options are less than ideal due to its size and scale. However, the ever-changing situation may ultimately work out in Apple’s favor after the president has indicated that extreme cases may be given special treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/04/09/trump-blinks-floats-suggestion-that-apple-might-get-a-tariff-exemption\">spotted by AppleInsider</a>, Trump responded to a question about tariff exemptions, which he had previously denied would happen, by hinting at a less hardline and more vibes-based approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Would you consider exempting some US companies,” asked a journalist, “maybe some larger companies who have been hit hard in the markets the last few days, during [the 90-day pause]?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As time goes by, we’re going to take a look at it,” Trump replied. “There are some that have been hard… There are some that by the nature of the company get hit a little bit harder, and we’ll take a look at that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“How will you determine [inaudible]?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Just… instinctively, more than anything else. I mean, you almost can’t take a pencil to paper. It’s really more of an instinct I think, than anything else.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has made efforts to conciliate the president since his second electoral victory, including a million-dollar personal donation by Tim Cook to the inauguration fund, so Apple should be in a good position to win concessions. Perhaps those <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2660799/apples-bad-no-good-week.html\">million dollars</a> were well spent after all.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"14314f0437108c5a93084b0047a5b212be253dd0f830539bf023cb2c7d5fd1d1","category":"Apple"}
