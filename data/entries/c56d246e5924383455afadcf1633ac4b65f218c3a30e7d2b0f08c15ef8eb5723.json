Maybe Tailfin has the answer…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tailfin</i></span></div>\n<p>The SFM system on both versions has an adjustable fork clamp designed to work with fork lowers with a diameter of between 38mm and 45mm, which correlates to forks with 30mm to 36mm diameter stanchions.</p>\n<p>This means it’s compatible with forks as burly as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-fox-36-factory-grip2-fork-review/\">Fox 36</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-rockshox-lyrik-ultimate-fork-review/\">RockShox Lyrik</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Everything from XC bikes through to rowdy trail bikes can now take Tailfin’s rack.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tailfin</i></span></div>\n<p>Tailfin claims that it is the stiffest, strongest and lowest profile system on the market, and provides data to demonstrate this.</p>\n<p>It also claims that the SFM won’t scratch your fork, nor suffer from position creep during use – something Tailfin says other solutions may suffer from. Creep can, in the worst situations, lead to luggage hitting a wheel’s spokes.</p>\n<p>When tightened to 3Nm, Tailfin claims the SFM rack took twice the force to start slipping around the fork leg than some of its competitors.</p>\n<p>Likewise, it also claims that the SFM is double the stiffness of its competitors, which means less detrimental impacts on handling when riding with up to 3kg of luggage per rack (the weight limit of the product on singletrack – this rises to 5kg for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel</a>).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Anything cages and bottle cages can be bolted onto the SFM.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tailfin</i></span></div>\n<p>The kits come with a pair of mounts, which themselves can carry up to two bottles or Anything cages, adding considerable luggage capabilities to your bike.</p>\n<p>So long as the bottle cage or Anything cage use a standard 5mm Allen bolt, they should be compatible.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The system is designed to avoid creep when rattling over rough terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tailfin</i></span></div>\n<p>The carbon version of the SFM weighs a claimed 82g for the pair and costs £50 / $70 / €60, while the stainless steel version weighs a claimed 128g for the pair and costs £30 / $40 / €35.</p>\n<p>The carbon SFM will be available from 2 November and the stainless steel version from 1 December.
