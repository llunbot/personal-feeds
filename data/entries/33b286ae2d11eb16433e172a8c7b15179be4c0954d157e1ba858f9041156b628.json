Apple said it developed an algorithm that detects the \"unique signature\" of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb are tapped together.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA similar but more limited <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/\">accessibility feature called AssistiveTouch</a> is already available on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth new Apple Watch models launch this Friday, but Double Tap will require watchOS 10.1. For now, the latest version is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-1/\">watchOS 10.0.1</a>, released today.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/double-tap/\">Double Tap</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/watchos-10-1-double-tap/\">watchOS 10.1 to Enable Apple Watch's New 'Double Tap' Gesture</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-to-enable-apple-watchs-new-double-tap-gesture.2403716/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"33b286ae2d11eb16433e172a8c7b15179be4c0954d157e1ba858f9041156b628","category":"Apple"}
