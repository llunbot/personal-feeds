On the\ncontrary, the human mind is a surprisingly efficient and even\nelegant system that operates with small amounts of information; it\nseeks not to infer brute correlations among data points but to\ncreate explanations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/15/chomsky-chatgpt\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"697fd8c8e9413dbc6e259dc05576798d60361b6d90d4450c9b2e5f136badaad9","category":"Tech"}
