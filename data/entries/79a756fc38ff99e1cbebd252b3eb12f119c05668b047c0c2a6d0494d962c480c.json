I had been riding my BMX bike on the local mountain bike trails just to see if I could do it. Turns out, I could, but it was a little more struggle than I was looking for, even as I tried to convince myself that it was good training for the racing I was doing at the local BMX track.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_05.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_05.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_05.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_05.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_05.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_02.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_02.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_02.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_02.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_018.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_018.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_018.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_018.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_018.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I wanted the same feeling as a BMX bike, but I also knew I was going to be primarily riding it on the trails. I settled on searching for a small classic mountain bike frame to give the BMX feel, but the mountain bike geometry. I happened upon what was at the time a completely original 1984 Schwinn High Sierra with bullmoose bars and the timeless Araya 26×1.75 wheels.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_07.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_07.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_07.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_07.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_07.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_019.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_019.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_019.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_019.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_019.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_06.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_06.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_06.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_06.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_06.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>For some reason, I saw the ice-blue frame and immediately started thinking white. I powdercoated white the original Dia Compe brake levers, calipers (I call them pea pods), Shimano MX pedals (since broken), Tourney cranks (since broken), and glorious SR MTE-100 seatpost. I scrounged up some white S&amp;M Slam Bars and popped on a white SE Blitz seat and started sending it– out of the saddle riding only, of course!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_022.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_022.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_022.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_022.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_022.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_023.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_023.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_023.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_023.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_023.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_021.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_021.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_021.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_021.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_021.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I’ve been through a lot with this bike, but it just continues to hold up and put a smile on my face. Every time I get behind the bars on this thing I feel like I’m riding my first bike all over again, and that was totally the point.</p>\n<p>I broke the original rear axle, then the replacement axle. I broke off a front brake boss, had it re-welded, then bent the original forks (apparently the breather holes located right behind and below the bosses are a common failure point). I rounded off the original cranks after bashing a rock on the trail. I broke the axle on one of the original Shimano pedals. Most recently, I cracked a headset cup.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_015.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_015.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_015.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_015.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_015.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>What can I say? I don’t collect anything and I ride everything :)</p>\n<p>Last season, I finally ditched the original “sealed system” high-flange hubs and went with some green TNT Revolvers straight outta the BMX old-school, laced with Phil spokes and nips to the original Araya rims. Butter. I thought the green would nicely reference the tiny trees in the top tube decal. The rest of the components and style are a real mix of MTB and BMX at this point that works really well for the way I ride it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_017.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_017.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_017.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_017.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_017.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_04.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_04.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_04.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_04.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_04.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>There has certainly been some trial-by-error building that has brought it to the current setup, but the real steel goodness of the frame and the playfulness of the build persists on.</p>\n<p>“Man, that reminds me of my first BMX bike” is something I hear from folks out on the trail a lot.</p>\n<p>Exactly, my friend, exactly :)</p>\n<p>To add to the nostalgia, the pictures here were all taken on film (expired Fuji 200) after a recent ride.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_024.jpg?fit=1200,1325&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_024.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_024.jpg?resize=1200,795&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_024.jpg?resize=768,509&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Schwinn_High_Sierra_024.jpg?resize=1536,1018&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my bike and having an awesome site!<br />\nSam Affholter<br />\nYpsilanti, MI</p>\n<p><strong>Build Spec:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Year: 1984</li>\n<li>S/N:</li>\n<li>Frame: Schwinn High Sierra</li>\n<li>Forks: Tange Cro-mo unicrown</li>\n<li>Stem: SR BMX canti-mount, Haro Stem Saver spacer</li>\n<li>Headset: Origin8 Pro</li>\n<li>Bottom Bracket: Shimano UN55</li>\n<li>Handlebar: S&amp;M Slam Bars</li>\n<li>Brake Levers: Dia-Compe</li>\n<li>Front Brake: Dia-Compe</li>\n<li>Rear Brake: Dia-Compe</li>\n<li>Brake Pads: Kool-Stop Eagle II</li>\n<li>Cables/Housing: Odyssey Slic Cable</li>\n<li>Crankset: Sugino Super Maxy</li>\n<li>Chainring: Profile Racing MTB Downhill ring, 40t w/integrated bash guard</li>\n<li>Pedals: Free Agent</li>\n<li>Hubs: TNT Revolver bolt-on</li>\n<li>Rims: Araya 26×1.75</li>\n<li>Tires: Specialized Fast Track Sport 26×2.35</li>\n<li>Seatpost: SR MTE-100</li>\n<li>Saddle: SE Blitz</li>\n<li>Seatpost QR:</li>\n<li>Grips: SE Wing</li>\n<li>Chain: KMC Z1eHX</li>\n<li>Freewheel: White Industries ENO 20t</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
