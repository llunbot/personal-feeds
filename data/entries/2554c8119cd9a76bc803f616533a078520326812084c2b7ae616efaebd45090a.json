(In 2018 and 2019, when WWDC was a real in-person conference in San Jose, tickets sold out almost instantaneously.)</p>\n\n<p>Also: at least one sponsorship slot is still available. If you’ve got a product or service you’d like to see me promote at the start of the show, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/contact/\">shoot me an email</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/03/the-talk-show-live-tickets-2025\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2554c8119cd9a76bc803f616533a078520326812084c2b7ae616efaebd45090a","category":"Tech"}
