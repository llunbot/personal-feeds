The GRID 4 features a disassembled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 4, with all of the components skillfully arranged to give a look back at Apple's history.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone‌ 4 is one of Apple's most notable designs, because it introduced the first major design update after the original ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPhone‌ 3G, and ‌iPhone‌ 3GS. It featured an all-new look with squared edges that felt decidedly modern at the time, and it is an aesthetic that Apple returned to starting with the ‌iPhone‌ 12.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/grid-studio-4-01.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nGRID's ‌iPhone‌ 4 piece includes the ‌iPhone‌ 4 internals, ranging from the logic board with Apple A4 chip and PowerVR GPU to the iconic Home button. Components are labeled and arranged in a logical way so you can tell what's what. GRID's art makes a great gift for any Apple enthusiast, and there are many other <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/collections/iphone\">disassembled iPhone options</a> ranging from the original ‌iPhone‌ to the ‌iPhone‌ X.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/grid-studio-t-shirt-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn addition to the sale on the ‌iPhone‌ 4, GRID is discounting all of its products by 15 percent. GRID customers who spend over $30 this week can get a special <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-earth-day-eco-tee\">Earth Day Eco Tee</a> for just $9.99, with the shirt featuring a recycling logo made up of a ton of tiny Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/grid-studio-t-shirt-3.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWe have one 256GB ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ to give away to a <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
