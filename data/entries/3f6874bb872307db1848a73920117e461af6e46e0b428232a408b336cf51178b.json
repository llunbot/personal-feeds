But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/p/-/apple-airtag-2nd-generation-4-pack-includes-additional-airtag-1-pack-2nd-generation/4000277035\">five new AirTags for the price of 4</a>, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3049223/apple-airtag-2nd-gen-review.html\">tested the new AirTag 2</a> and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So grab your <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/p/-/apple-airtag-2nd-generation-4-pack-includes-additional-airtag-1-pack-2nd-generation/4000277035\">4+1 AirTag 2 deal over at Costco for $100</a> while this combo is still available.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.costco.com/p/-/apple-airtag-2nd-generation-4-pack-includes-additional-airtag-1-pack-2nd-generation/4000277035&amp;xcust=1-1-3066031-7-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Costco</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3f6874bb872307db1848a73920117e461af6e46e0b428232a408b336cf51178b","category":"Apple"}
