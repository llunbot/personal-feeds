The cause was not an unwelcome visit from the ghost of mechanical timepieces past but the International Trade Commission, which found that the California-based computer maker had infringed on some patents. Now, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-administration-allows-us-trade-tribunals-ban-apple-watch-imports-2023-12-26/\">Reuters reports</a> that Apple has filed an emergency request for the courts to lift the ban and will appeal the ITC ruling.</p>\n<p>Apple's watch problems started back in January. That's when a court found that the light-based pulse oximetry sensor (found on the back of the watches) infringed patents held by Masimo, a medical device manufacturer also based in California.</p>\n<p>At the time, Apple said since Masimo was not a consumer-focused company, it chose not to collaborate or acquire the medical device maker. Masimo, for its part, said that Apple led it on in discussions then took its idea and hired away Masimo engineers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992857#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992857&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
