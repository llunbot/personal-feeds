For many, that means hanging up the bikes for the season. But for the hearty, it simply means a change of scenery – and clothing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one knows that better than 45NRTH. The name says it all, but the winter clothing and tire experts from up north live it every year. Their newest footwear option is called the Oland, and they don’t look like your typical cycling boots. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"45NRTH Oland \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-04-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the Olands are built with a “premium waterproof” leather construction that instantly reminded us of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hands-on-45nrth-x-red-wing-leather-limited-edition-wolvhammer-winter-cycling-boot/\">45NRTH x Red Wing Leather Limited Edition Wölvhammers.</a> It’s important to note that the Olands are NOT made with Red Wing Leather, but the ECCO leather used for the Olands should break in similarly to the Leather Wölvhammers which is part of why those boots have become my favorite winter option. 45NRTH points out that ECCO’s leather is “made with Bioscavenge and DriTan technology to save and recycle water during manufacturing. Leather Working Group-certified.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"45NRTH Oland laces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-02-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"45NRTH Oland laces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-08-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"45NRTH Oland laces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-05-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the Olands, you’ll find 100g Primaloft insulation which gives them a recommended temperature rating of 20º to 45ºF / -7º to 7ºC. Unlike the Wölvhammers, or any other 45NRTH boot, the Olands use a traditional lace closure with a high top cut. The lower lace guides are captured, while the upper two pairs are hooked so you can easily unlace and open the tongue – which is required to get your foot in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to fit, the Olands seem to be right on the money with past 45NRTH boots. I requested a pair of 42s which are the same as my Wölvhammers and Ragnaroks, and the fit is just about perfect with a pair of 45NRTH Swiftwick winter socks (which are definitely thicker than most cycling socks, but not the thickest winter sock). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Oland insole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-01-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside you’ll find a thin, but sculped Syksol insole.

Also, the back of the upper cuff is made from a more stretchy material to allow it to flex as you pedal. I will say that initially, pedaling in the Olands is a bit stiff, but better than expected – and it should only improve as they break in. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"45NRTH Oland actual weight\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/45NRTH-Oland-leather-winter-cycling-commuter-boot-03-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the scale, a single 42-size boot checks in at 651g. Compare that to 894g for the same size 45NRTH x Red Wing boot and it’s clear that the Oland is a good bit lighter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"45NRTH Oland on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_027-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"45NRTH Oland photo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240327_45N_Oland_Lifestyle_135-1-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Above Photos/Jeff Lathrop 45NRTH)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 45NRTH Oland will sell for $260 in sizes 36-44, 46, and 50.
