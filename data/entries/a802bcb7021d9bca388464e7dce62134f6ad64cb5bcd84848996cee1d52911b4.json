As a result, Kuo believes Apple is anticipating a major increase in demand for its own USB-C 20W Power Adapter. From his latest post on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/領益智造為iphone-15系列改採usb-c與apple顯著調升20w-usb-c充電出貨預估的主要贏家-ly-itech-is-the-primary-beneficiary-of-the-79743df328f\">Medium</a>:\r<br />\n<blockquote>I believe Apple will optimize the fast charging performance of MFi-certified chargers for the iPhone 15. Among Apple's chargers, the 20W USB-C model is the most cost-effective choice for iPhone users, resulting in strong replacement demand for 20W USB-C chargers.</blockquote>In addition to the benefits of owning an Apple-certified charger, Kuo believes that another potential driving factor behind the strong replacement demand will be iPhone 15 customers' desire to own more than one USB-C charger to meet the need for more charging locations. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven these factors, Kuo says that shipments of Apple's USB-C 20W Power Adapter in 2023 are \"expected to see a significant 30–40% YoY growth, amounting to 230–240 million units,\" with Apple supplier LY iTech standing out as the main beneficiary in terms of revenue contribution.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince being introduced in 2012, first-party and MFi-certified Lightning ports and connectors have contained a small integrated circuit that confirms the authenticity of the parts involved in the connection. Non-MFi-certified third-party charging cables do not feature this chip, often leading to \"This accessory is not supported\" warnings on connected Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/10/apple-planning-to-limit-iphone-15-usb-c-port/\">Rumors</a> have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/\">suggested</a> that the replacement USB-C port on iPhone 15 models will continue to have a Lightning-like authentication chip, despite USB-C ports on Apple's iPads having no such chip. The concern from a user perspective is that Apple will use the MFi program to limit features like fast charging and high-speed data transfer to Apple and MFi-certified cables. Kuo's latest prediction appears to suggest the same.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/\">previously claimed</a> that the USB-C port on the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus will remain limited to Lightning/USB 2.0 speeds, while faster transfer speeds will be exclusive to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/\">USB-C iPhone</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/\">Kuo: iPhone 15 MFi Requirements Expected to Boost Apple USB-C Charger Shipments</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-15-mfi-requirements-expected-to-boost-apple-usb-c-charger-shipments.2384286/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a802bcb7021d9bca388464e7dce62134f6ad64cb5bcd84848996cee1d52911b4","category":"Apple"}
