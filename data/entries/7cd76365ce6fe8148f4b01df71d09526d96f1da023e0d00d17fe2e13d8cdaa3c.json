It's a big week for big rockets, with SpaceX potentially launching its next Starship test flight and a Falcon Heavy rocket with NASA's Europa Clipper mission this weekend. And a week ago, United Launch Alliance flew its second Vulcan rocket, which lost one of its booster nozzles in midair and amazingly kept going to achieve a successful mission.

The company also revealed that it was working on a crew capsule called Lince (Spanish for Lynx). PLD Space introduced its Miura Next, Miura Next Heavy, and Miura Next Super Heavy launch vehicles, designed in single stick, triple core, and quintuple core configurations with reusable boosters. At the high end of the rocket family's performance, the Miura Next Super Heavy could deliver up to 53 metric tons (nearly 117,000 pounds) of payload to low-Earth orbit. The Lince capsule could become Europe's first human-rated crew transportation spacecraft.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/rocket-report-europa-clipper-on-hold-for-milton-spanish-startups-big-ambitions/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/rocket-report-europa-clipper-on-hold-for-milton-spanish-startups-big-ambitions/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7cd76365ce6fe8148f4b01df71d09526d96f1da023e0d00d17fe2e13d8cdaa3c","category":"Tech"}
