Smith was seemingly baffled to find that the \"district court performed, essentially, no analysis on this question.\"</p>\n<p>According to Smith, the district court \"offered no reason\" for finding that AB 587 only compelled commercial speech \"except for wanting\" to follow \"the lead of the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits,” which never dealt with \"speech similar\" to AB 587's required content moderation reports. Instead, Smith said, the district court seemed to take up California's invitation to invent a new category of commercial speech that did not clash with the First Amendment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047493#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047493&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d8dacba30b3c46f6432c2baf1952013ae3869520d5855763a0d3edd6a0fff538","category":"Tech"}
