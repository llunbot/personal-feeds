Right now, with some off-the-shelf gear and the patience to flash and fiddle, you can ask “Nabu” or “Jarvis” or any name you want to turn off some lights, set the thermostat, or run automations. And you can ask about the weather. Narrowly defined mission: Accomplished.</p>\n<p>In a broader, more accurate sense, Home Assistant voice control has a ways to go. Your verb set is limited to toggling, setting, and other smart home interactions. The easiest devices to use for this don’t have the best noise cancellation or pick-up range. Errors aren’t handled gracefully, and you get the best results by fine-tuning the names you call everything you control.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000574#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000574&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"241e39f8d25bf00d6c183cc984c0a8c6d32d1108fb911859b4ff93bddbdff88a","category":"Tech"}
