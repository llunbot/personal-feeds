The seven-stage race was previously known as the Ceratizit Challenge by La Vuelta and held in September across five days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having crossed the line first as her Jumbo-Visma team won the opening stage team time-trial, Anna Henderson is wearing the first red jersey of the race. It‚Äôs shaping up to be a great week of racing, with an exciting finish up to Lagos de Covadonga on Sunday. Will SD Worx‚Äôs Demi Vollering continue her campaign of dominance from her Ardennes Classics triple success into the Grand Tours or will Annemiek van Vleuten prove she‚Äôs still the stage race queen in her final season? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.
