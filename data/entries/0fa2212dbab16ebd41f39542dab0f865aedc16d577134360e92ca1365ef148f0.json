Its 9.8-foot wingspan casts a looming silhouette against the sunlight; the sound of its flight is like that of a light aircraft cutting through the wind. In this forest thick with trees up to 600 years old lives the southernmost population of the California condor (<em>Gymnogyps californianus</em>), the only one outside the United States. Dozens of the scavenging birds have been reintroduced here, to live and breed once again in the wild.</p>\n<p>Their return has been captained for more than 20 years by biologist Juan Vargas Velasco and his partner María Catalina Porras Peña, a couple who long ago moved away from the comforts of the city to endure extreme winters living in a tent or small trailer, to manage the lives of the 48 condors known to fly over Mexican territory. Together—she as coordinator of the California Condor Conservation Program, and he as field manager—they are the guardians of a project whose origins go back to condor recovery efforts that began in the 1980s in the United States, when populations were decimated, mainly from eating the meat of animals shot by hunters’ lead bullets.</p>\n<p>In Mexico, the species disappeared even earlier, in the late 1930s. Its historic return—the first captive-bred condors were released into Mexican territory in 2002—is the result of close binational collaboration among <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2023/zoos-need-change\">zoos</a> and other institutions in the United States and Mexico.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/return-of-the-california-condor/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/return-of-the-california-condor/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ivan Cárrillo, Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0fa2212dbab16ebd41f39542dab0f865aedc16d577134360e92ca1365ef148f0","category":"Tech"}
