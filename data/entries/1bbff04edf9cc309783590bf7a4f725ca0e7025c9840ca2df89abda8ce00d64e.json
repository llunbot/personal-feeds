Usually, the company does a big \"Pro\" phone with three cameras and all the premium features and then a smaller Pixel that gets cut down somewhat, usually with only two cameras. Those January renders showed a big and small phone <em>both</em> with three cameras, indicating the base model Pixel 9 was getting updated to be a \"mini-Pro\" model—a smaller phone, but still with all the trimmings. The small Pro model still seems to be in the works, but apparently, that's not the base model.</p>\n<p>The new render from <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/\">OnLeaks and 91Mobiles</a> shows a <em>third</em> Pixel 9. This one is the usual cut-down small model with only two cameras. Apparently, the lineup would now be a 6.8-inch \"Pixel 9 Pro XL,\" a \"Pixel 9 Pro\" at 6.1 inches, and a \"Pixel 9\" at 6.0 inches.</p>\n<p>The base model's design looks just like the other Pixel 9 leaks. The camera bar takes on a new rounded pill shape. The sides switch to a flat metal band, like an iPhone 4/15. The corners of the display and phone body are much more rounded.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012841#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012841&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1bbff04edf9cc309783590bf7a4f725ca0e7025c9840ca2df89abda8ce00d64e","category":"Tech"}
