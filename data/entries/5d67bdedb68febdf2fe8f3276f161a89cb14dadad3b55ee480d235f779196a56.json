Yet, so far at least, that hasn't been enough to offset the rise of fossil fuel use in that country. But <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-clean-energy-just-put-chinas-co2-emissions-into-reverse-for-first-time/\">a new analysis</a> by the NGO Carbon Brief suggests things may be changing, as China's emissions have now dropped over the past year, showing a 1 percent decline compared to the previous March. The decline is largely being led by the power sector, where growth in renewables has surged above rising demand.</p>\n<p>This isn't the first time that China's emissions have gone down over the course of a year, but in all previous cases the cause was primarily economic—driven by things like the COVID pandemic or the 2008 housing crisis. The latest shift, however, was driven largely by the country's energy sector, which saw a 2 percent decline in emissions over the past year.</p>\n<img width=\"1536\" height=\"916\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image.png\" alt=\"Image of a graph, showing a general rise with small periods of decline.
