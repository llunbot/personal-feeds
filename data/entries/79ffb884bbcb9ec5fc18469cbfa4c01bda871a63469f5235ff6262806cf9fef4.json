I hope you take a look\nand <a href=\"https://tally.so/r/3yNAMd\">cast your vote</a>. Here’s a little about each of the\nfinalists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Personal favorites: Phil Gyford’s <a href=\"https://ooh.directory/\">Ooh.directory</a> (“a place to find good blogs that interest you”, previously linked from here <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/12/01/ooh-directory\">back in December</a>), and <a href=\"https://acronymy.net/\">Acronymy</a>, a dictionary in which every word is defined as an acronym.
