But now, some good news – WTB has just introduced their first-ever fat bike tire. Packed with WTB DNA, the all-new Bailiff looks like it could be a great option for those looking for an aggressive fat bike tire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may be WTB’s first fat bike tire, but they’re quick to point to their four decades of tire design and hundreds of hours of testing in places like Vermont that went into the creation of the Bailiff. Offered only in 27.5 x 4.5″, we’re told that there are currently no plans to offer the tire in a 26″ size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built around a TCS Light High Grip 120 tpi casing, the Bailiff focuses on providing a supple feel when aired down to fat bike pressures. The tire also gets a snow-specific tire compound that is intended to stay pliable in extreme cold to maintain traction. That TCS casing also means the tire is fully tubeless compatible with tire sealant. In case you’re wondering, the WTB tire sealant is optimized for temperatures down to 15F° / -9.4°C. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tread Pattern</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Bailiff fat bike tire 27.5 x 4.5-12\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-11-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread pattern itself features closely spaced center knobs to minimize rolling resistance, but there are still plenty of working edges to bite when you need traction to slow down. The knobs are fairly tall compared to some lighter fat bike tires and are widely spaced to dig in both soft and hard snow, mud, sand, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Bailiff fat bike tire 27.5 x 4.5-12\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-10-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When fitted to a 77mm internal width rim, the tire has a nicely rounded profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Bailiff fat bike tire studded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Bailiff fat bike tire studs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Offered in studded or studless versions, each tire has 312 stud pockets which are compatible with Terrene, 45NRTH, and other popular tire studs.

As such, they’re hefty at 1617g for the studless version. The studded version comes in at 1693g.

Still no snow. It looks like we’re in for a brief Arctic blast next week, so hopefully I can <em>finally</em> get out on these tires and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-otso-voytek-2-most-adjustable-fat-bike-plus-bike/\">Otso Voytek 2</a> in the snow (or at least frozen trails). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can tell you that while the tires were tight to get onto my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/just-in-whisky-parts-co-no-9-80w-27-5-carbon-fat-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Whisky No. 9 80w wheels</a>, the tires seated up tubeless without issue. The rubber on the bead felt particularly grippy, so I applied some Schwalbe Easy Fit to the bead which made it much easier to fit the tire to the rim. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once seated and inflated to 12psi, the tires measured an actual 4.3″ wide on the rims with a 77mm internal width. Upon measuring them the next day, they had already expanded to 4.4″, measured at the widest point of the tread blocks. So while a little undersized out of the package, it seems like these might expand to the full 4.5″ width with some time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>About that Packaging</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Bailiff fat bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-8-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Bailiff fat bike tire recycled cardboard packaging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-6.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"WTB Bailiff fat bike tire with cargo strap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WTB-Bailiff-fat-bike-tire-27.5-x-4.5-7.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fat bike tires are big, obviously. Some brands package them in large cardboard boxes. Others zip tie them to cardboard or plastic sleeves. At one point, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tire-tech-how-do-the-new-27-5-fat-bike-tires-measure-up-against-26/\" target=\"_blank\">Maxxis was even putting them in reusable drawstring bags</a>. But of all the fat bike tire packages I’ve opened, the WTB Bailiff is the best yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you go to unwrap a Bailiff, you’ll find a reusable 25″ cargo strap and a small label made from recycled cardboard that is further recyclable. I’ve been meaning to buy some longer cargo straps for a while now – but now I have some thanks to the packaging of these tires. I can’t tell you the difference in quality between these straps and something like a genuine Voile Strap, but these will definitely come in handy. Use them to cinch down a spare fat bike tube for your ride.
