The company\nsays that this is part of its environmental goals, as it strives\nto ensure its packaging is completely plastic-free.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Stores, however, are receiving shipments with a limited\nquantity of Apple logo stickers that can be distributed to\ncustomers who buy a new iPad Pro or iPad Air, but only upon\nrequest. So, if you buy an iPad Pro or iPad Air from an Apple\nStore, you can request an Apple sticker at the time of purchase.</p>\n\n<p>When Apple Stores run out of their supply of stickers, they can\norder more from Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Boo hiss. The fun of those stickers outweighs their environmental impact. Seriously, who thinks including a couple of stickers in the box is hurting the environment?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/09/no-more-stickers-with-new-ipads\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a6e70623d732e26ab469c782dc75519487eeaf28cb47c256acada21325b3b5f1","category":"Tech"}
