The first is that every\nimprovement is a trade-off. Protecting bus lanes with concrete\nbarriers, for example, would keep cars out, but it would also keep\nlimited-stop buses from passing local ones. Our street\nincorporates a possible set of compromises. The second is that\neven simple tweaks imply a far-reaching organizational overhaul.\nEnclosed trash bins would push the Department of Sanitation to\nupdate some of its trucks and pickup procedures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a lot of good ideas here. Drastically reducing curbside parking and using that space to widen sidewalks and increase outdoor eating areas is something that’s happened in a lot of cities during this pandemic. It’s been a huge win here in Philly.</p>\n\n<p>But to nitpick one of the ideas: enclosed trash bins are <em>terrible</em>. Philly replaced its old-fashioned open-top trash bins with <a href=\"https://bigbelly.com/products/\">enclosed ones</a> several years ago, and they’re just awful. They sound like a fine idea, but in practice they’re disgusting. You have to touch them to put anything in them, and, well, they’re covered with garbage. They’re really hard to use one-handed, like when you’re carrying, say, a grocery bag with your other hand. They tend to break, too. It’s been a huge step backwards here.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/12/new-york-city-street\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c020c48a06b39979afaa1ce02098865d3ad150b07ccab0217b05d8dda28ae927","category":"Tech"}
