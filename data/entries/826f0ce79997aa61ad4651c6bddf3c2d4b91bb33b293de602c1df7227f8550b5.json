Here’s what we’ve heard so far, and what we expect based on Apple’s recent history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following WWDC on June 5 we have had a preview of a number of new features and apps coming to the iPhone software in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a>, from new apps including Standby (which borrows from the Apple Watch to create an alarm clock on your bedside table experience), to the Journal app (which will enhance Photos memories and mix in other kinds of media), to Live Voicemail and the ability to leave messages in FaceTime. Safety features such as the ability to track someone on their way home and improvements to the way AirDrop works. Also of interest will be the new features coming in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Apple Vision Pro headset</a>, and any impact they could have on the future of the iPhone.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what you are interested in is what the new iPhone will be like and when the new iPhone is coming out, and we are here to answer those questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated September 8</strong> The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">latest from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg</a> affirms previous rumors. All the action is on the Pro models, with slimmer bezels, better cameras, enhanced telephoto on the Pro Max model, titanium, USB-C, the 3nm A17, the Action Button, and more. The non-pro models get the A16, Dynamic Island, and a 48 megapixel main camera.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumors at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> 6.1-inch display but Dynamic Island and smaller bezels, A16 processor, 6GB LPDDR5 RAM, better batteries, U2 chip, USB-C replacing Lightning, mute switch replaced with solid-state button, green, yellow, and pink color choices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Plus:</strong> 6.7-inch display with Dynamic Island and smaller bezels, A16 processor, 6GB RAM LPDDR5 RAM, better batteries, U2 chip, USB-C replacing Lightning, mute switch replaced with solid-state button, green, yellow, and pink color choices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro: </strong>same 6.1-inch display with ProMotion and Dynamic Island, slimmer bezels and rounded corners, A17 processor, 8GB RAM, 2TB option, better batteries, U2 chip, USB-C replacing Lightning, mute switch replaced with Action button, ‘Titan Gray’ color option.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max (or Ultra): </strong>same 6.7-inch display with ProMotion and Dynamic Island, slimmest bezels and rounded corners, A17 processor, 8GB RAM, 2TB option, better batteries, U2 chip, USB-C replacing Lightning, mute switch replaced with Action button, periscope lens with 6x optical zoom, support for 8K video recording, new Titan Gray color, higher price.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2045866/iphone-15-event-invite-wonderlust-september-12.html\">announced Tuesday, September 12</a> as the date for its annual iPhone event, which will be called “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2046187/wonderlust-event-invite-clues-colors-apple-watch-iphone-15-airpods.html\">Wonderlust</a>.” Based on that, we expect preorders to begin on Friday, September 15, and the phones to arrive on Friday, September 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s when the last few generations arrived in stores:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 14, Pro, and Pro Max:</strong> September 16, 2022. <strong>iPhone 14 Plus</strong>, October 7, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 13, mini, <strong>Pro, and Pro Max</strong>:</strong> September 24, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 12 and Pro:</strong> October 23, 2020. <strong>iPhone 12 mini and Max</strong>: November 6, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 11, Pro, and Pro Max:</strong> September 20, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone XS and Max:</strong> September 21, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some rumors have suggested that there could be a split on-sale date in 2023, with certain models shipping later than others (as was the case in 2022 and 2020). However, a report in August 2023 claimed that all four models would <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2044559/iphone-15-pro-shipment-date-september.html\">ship at the same time</a>, though it’s possible that supplies of the iPhone 15 Pro Max will be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2048457/iphone-15-pro-max-production-issues-contrained-launch.html\">constrained at launch</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 14 models, Apple kept the price the same in the U.S., but thanks to exchange rates and inflation, had to raise prices in the U.K. and many other countries. For reference, here’s the pricing on the iPhone 14 line:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 14</strong>: $799/£849</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 14 Plus</strong>: $899/£949</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro</strong>: $999/£1,099</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro Max</strong>: $1,099/£1,199</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2023 rumors point to a higher price for the Pro and Pro Max, but a lower price for the Plus models. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple does indeed re-brand the iPhone 15 Pro Max as the iPhone 15 Ultra (see below) and give it some exclusive new features, we think that will prove enough of an excuse to raise prices on that model, perhaps $100/£100. In fact, in July 2023 Barclays analyst Tim Long suggested that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2010727/you-might-be-paying-a-lot-more-for-the-iphone-15-pro-max.html\">price hike for the Pro Max could be $200</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1590762157712760833&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">tweet by LeaksApplePro</a> in November 2022 said it expects the iPhone 15 Ultra to “cost substantially more to manufacture than iPhone 14 Pro Max.” That doesn’t necessarily mean it will cost more, but it’s a good indication that it might.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>iPhone 15 Ultra will cost substantially more to manufacture than iPhone 14 Pro Max</p>— LeaksApplePro (@LeaksApplePro) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1590762157712760833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">November 10, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1444061/iphone-14-plus-sales-price-cut-rumors.html\">rumor in December</a> claimed that Apple is “seriously” considering a price cut to the iPhone 15 Plus following disappointing sales of the iPhone 14 Plus this year. However, it could be noted that with the iPhone 14 Plus costing $200 less than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, disappointing sales of one phone could result in better sales of the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A price drop for the iPhone 15 Plus should also result in a price cut for the iPhone 15. When Apple removed the cheaper iPhone mini from the lineup with the iPhone 14 it effectively raised the starting price of the lineup, so a lower price for the iPhone 15 would be welcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on these claims, we’ve estimated the following <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2010898/iphone-15-pro-max-plus-features-pricing.html\">prices for the iPhone 15 line-up</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 15</strong>: $749</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Plus</strong>: $849</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro</strong>: $1,099</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>: $1,299</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 Ultra or iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Apple has introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1061837/apple-watch-ultra-display-design-sensors-battery-life.html\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, there are rumors that the company will extend the branding to the iPhone line with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those rumors date back to late 2022 and died away for a while after it was reported that Apple would stick to the Pro Max branding. However, as we approach the launch the rumor that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2036956/iphone-15-ultra-pro-max-telephoto-camera-display.html\">Apple could launch an iPhone 15 Ultra</a> has emerged again. According to Apple Insider’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/andrew_osu/status/1692702380456853619?s=61&amp;t=78eod6n649tq9eA-OaTUPw&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Andrew O’Hara on X</a> (formerly Twitter), “Apple will indeed use the ‘iPhone 15 Ultra’ moniker for the plus-sized pro phone.” However, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is confident that the Ultra won’t arrive until next year if at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>There’s only one new high-end 6.7 inch iPhone. No Pro Max and Ultra this year. Perhaps next year as I wrote in February. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/mSVCEotmtG&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/mSVCEotmtG</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/OGrU2l3iKn&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/OGrU2l3iKn</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1697768772873146589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">September 2, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The assumption is that the iPhone 15 Ultra would be the branding used for the variant, and there would be <em>some</em> sort of new features to differentiate it. Apple did this once before with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which had a slightly better camera than the iPhone 12 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So most people expect that the camera will once again be the feature that sets apart the new Ultra phone, possibly with a better periscope telephoto camera (see below). The rumor mill has lots of other ideas for how Apple could make the Ultra version stand out, such as faster charging or more storage, but most of them aren’t substantiated by any evidence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hypothetical iPhone 15 Ultra could otherwise be thought of as an iPhone 15 Pro Max–it is assumed to use the same processor, display, and design as the iPhone 15 Pro (though <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1583087610460717056&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">LeaksApplePro reports</a> that it could have a titanium body like the Apple Watch Ultra).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra wrist\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3164w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-wrist.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption>The iPhone  15 Ultra may come in titanium like the Apple Watch Ultra.</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple has kept the same general design since the iPhone 12, rumors suggest that a change may be in store for the iPhone 15. Here’s what we’re hearing about the look of the next iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2022 ShrimpApple Pro tweeted that the iPhone 15 will be made from titanium instead of stainless steel. Titanium is strong, though not necessarily as strong as steel, but it is lighter. This new finish may be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max much like the Apple Watch Ultra. Several reports have corroborated these claims, so it’s extremely likely the new Pro phones will have a titanium body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Titanium could make the Pro phones much lighter as well. According to Revegnus on X, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will shed nearly 20 grams, which would make it the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2044133/iphone-15-pro-max-weight-titanium-stainless-steel.html\">lightest 6.7-inch iPhone Apple has ever made</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1594336832078385153&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">ShrimpApplePro on Twitter</a>, the iPhone 15 will feature “a new border design,” a claim that has been backed up by leaked CAD designs. As the leaker explains, the back edge corners will “be rounded [like the iPhone 11] and not square [like the iPhone 14]”. Based on the images below, it looks a bit like an updated version of the iPhone X but is still very similar to the iPhone 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>So the new iPhone 15<br />From the early information that I have, the iPhone 15 will feature a new border design.

This means Apple will have to transition several products over time, and instead of making special USB-C versions for Europe, will likely just change everything worldwide as we saw recently with the 10th-gen iPad and Siri remote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current iPhones use USB-C power adapters, so that won’t change, just the USB-C to Lightning cable and the port on the iPhone itself. The upside? Potentially faster charging and faster data transfer speeds for those who plug their iPhones into their Macs or PCs. In fact, the USB-C iPhone 15 might finally <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2035413/iphone-15-usb-c-35w-charging.html\">deliver fast charging at 35W</a>. Compared to a maximum of 20W on the iPhone 14 and 27W on the iPhone 14 Pro, 35W charging would represent a sizable improvement. It’s possible this improvement will apply to certain models only, rather than to the entire 15-series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is of course the possibility that Apple’s implementation of USB-C on the iPhone will require proprietary technology. Prolific leaker Majin Bu has posted photos of what could be internal components of the iPhone 15’s new port design, they suggest that there is a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2031286/photo-leak-confirms-iphone-15-usb-c-port.html\">new proprietary chip that seemingly controls the port</a>. This could enable Apple to limit charging speeds depending on the iPhone model or cable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are suggestions that the iPhone 15 Pro will get USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 support, with data transfer speeds of up to 20 or 40 Gbits per second. Faster charging speeds are a possibility but might require special USB-C cables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/22/exclusive-iphone-15-cads-reveal-larger-6-2-inch-display-dynamic-island-and-more/&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">CAD files obtained by 9to5Mac</a> show a USB-C port on the iPhone 15. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the USB-C port is slightly bigger than Lightning, it shouldn’t affect the thickness of the iPhone or the design. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dynamic Island</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant change to the display on the non-Pro iPhones is that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1069195/iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island-features-apps.html\">Dynamic Island</a>— that pill-shaped camera cutout that serves as an important interface element on iPhone 14 Pro–<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1070131/dynamic-island-iphone-15-models.html\">will come to <em>all</em> iPhone 15 models</a>. That means the non-Pro iPhones will have the same look and interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this doesn’t mean that the iPhone 15 will get an always-on display or ProMotion, though. Those features are currently rumored to remain exclusive to the Pro models.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 Pro dynamic island timer\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-14-timer-island.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>The Dynamic Island might come to all iPhone 15 models.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Jason Snell/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15: Specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple tests a lot of new technologies from a lot of suppliers, and over time little leaks can sometimes give us a clue as to what’s coming in the next iPhone. These leaks are sometimes wrong, often misunderstood, and generally miss software innovations that accompany the new hardware (such as Dynamic Island, where we only heard about the “pill and hole” cutout and not how Apple intended to make use of it).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what we currently expect to find inside the iPhone 15 line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Camera and Periscope camera lens</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors have said that Apple has been working on a “periscope lens” to offer a much longer-range optical zoom. One of the difficulties of placing a long focal length telephoto lens in smartphones is simply that of available space. In order to get a larger zoom, you need a combination of lenses set at distances that, if they were assembled using the traditional smartphone camera layout, would result in an absurdly large camera bump. To combat this the periscope design uses mirrors–like in a periscope–to allow those lenses to run lengthwise along the phone. According to rumors, if this design is adopted then the iPhone could achieve an optical zoom closer to 6x, or somewhere in the 5x to 10x range. It seems that this new periscope lens will only appear in the larger iPhone 15 Pro Max (or Ultra). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could still result in a much larger camera bump, with rumors claiming: “the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1780848/iphone-15-pro-renders-design-renders-camera.html\">camera bump will be bigger</a>, and “the individual lens protrusion has more than doubled.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the same technology that allows the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra to achieve such a long zoom range. The S22 Ultra’s cameras are much larger than the other models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the cameras on the other phones, you’ll probably still need an iPhone 15 Pro to take full advantage of the 48MP camera and the ProRAW format (which is required to capture full-sized 48MP photos). The Pro iPhones are still likely to be the only iPhones with LiDAR sensors (which can improve focus and portrait mode in dark environments, as well as being useful for AR apps). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2023, analyst Jeff Pu, claimed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1915806/iphone-15-budget-iphone-14-pro-usb-c.html\">non-Pro iPhones will get a 48MP main camera like that on the iPhone 14 Pro.</a> He says the new module will be slightly improved with a new triple-stacked sensor that can capture more light. According to Pu, this new design could possibly result in production delays for the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest camera improvements could come in the iPhone 16 series. Analyst Jeff Pu predicted in August 2023 that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2032042/iphone-16-pro-48mp-ultra-wide-camera-wifi-7.html\">iPhone 16 Pro will get a 48MP ultra-wide camera</a>. The iPhone 14 Pro got a 48MP wide-angle camera. A 48MP ultra-wide camera would presumably bring similar results to the ultra-wide camera and possibly a larger aperture as well for better clarity in challenging light.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A17 processor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next major processor manufacturing technology bump out of TSMC (the company that makes most of Apple’s chips) wasn’t ready yet for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1073243/a16-processor-cpu-gpu-lpddr5-memory-performance.html\">A16</a>. We think the A17 is likely to be one of the first mass-produced chips to use the chip manufacturer’s 3nm process, which should allow more transistors in the same area, allowing Apple to cram in more features and better performance. Read more about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1532925/a17-bionic-preview-benchmarks-cpu-gpu-ram.html\">How the A17 Bionic chip will take the iPhone 15 Pro to the next level</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some information about this new chip has leaked. Leaker Unknownz21 says the A17 will have very similar specs to the A16 despite the new 3nm process. He claims the following specs:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A17<br />CPU cores: 6<br />GPU cores: 6<br />Clock speed: 3.7GHz<br />RAM: 6GB LPDDR5</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A16<br />CPU cores: 6<br />GPU cores: 5<br />Clock speed: 3.46GHz<br />RAM: 6GB LPDDR5</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That suggests the biggest difference is an extra GPU core. But the 3nm process will likely bring much more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3nm process should bring more power efficiency, and the numbers quoted above don’t speak to those gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is unlikely to be a massive shift in battery life. We may see some improvement is in standby mode though. While the A16 was about 16 billion transistors, we can expect well over 20 billion for the A17. Along with this higher transistor budget, it seems ARM v9 instruction set support is likely. Apple’s new CPU cores for the A17 will almost certainly be faster, but not necessarily because of the shift to ARM v9</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 14 line, Apple reserved its new A16 for the Pro models and used the A15 again on the non-Pro models. We think that’s likely to continue in 2023, with the standard iPhone 15 using the A16 processor and the iPhone 15 Pro using the new A17.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Memory and storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the iPhone 14 Pro kept the same 6GB of memory as the iPhone 13 Pro, Trendforce reports that the iPhone 15 Pro/Ultra models will get 8GB of RAM, although leaker Unknownz indicates that 8GB of RAM is “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2027376/leaked-a17-chip-specs-cpu-gpu-cores-ram-clock-speed.html\">maybe not impossible</a>,” the leaker has “only seen 6GB so far; 8GB seems unlikely.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The non-Pro models are expected to have the same 6GB of RAM as this year, but they may adopt the LPDDR5 RAM from the iPhone 14 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors have pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2021930/iphone-15-pro-leaks-bezels-action-button-2tb-storage.html\">2TB option</a> that will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro’s storage, double the amount available on any iPhone before.

However, the source of the rumor backtracked a bit after the rumor gained traction. A follow-up rumor in July 2023 predicted that Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1997577/iphone-15-leaks-a-new-pink-color-super-skinny-bezels-and-stacked-batteries.html\">use a new “stacked” design</a> for the iPhone 15 battery, which may bring increased capacity and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another leaker RGcloudS claimed in July that Apple is using a stacked battery design for the iPhone 15, which could allow for bigger capacities. However, a rumor in September 2023 claimed that the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s battery would be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2052560/iphone-15-pro-max-battery-capacity-rumor.html\">only slightly larger</a> than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, though didn’t reference the other models. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>1/3<br />Stacked battery is on track, but limited<br /><br />Most likely only for 24U &amp; 24+<br />or just 24U<br /><br />meanwhile,<br />apple used it on entire iP15 lineup<br /><br />24U &amp; 24+ have \"rated\" 5000 MaH<br /><br />But 24U stacked structure is different<br />to make it cooler, they applied cooling gel. for 65W &amp; stability <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/8khM2oAToc&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/8khM2oAToc</a></p>— RGcloudS (@RGcloudS) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/RGcloudS/status/1679207858821529601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">July 12, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wi-Fi and 5G</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been working on its own cellular modem for <em>years</em> now, having acquired Intel’s modem unit in 2019 for $1B. While it was originally rumored that Apple could have a competitive 5G capable cellular modem <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345908/apples-homegrown-5g-modem-reportedly-wont-be-arriving-anytime-soon.html\">ready in time</a> to be part of the iPhone 15, recent rumors suggest that won’t be the case. Back in May, Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the development of the modem had hit a “roadblock,” and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1587922899268079616&amp;xcust=1-2-1351959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mark Gurman</a> reported in November that Qualcomm is expected to provide “the majority of new modems” for the iPhone 15. We should expect another Qualcomm Snapdragon modem instead, most likely the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/618603/apples-first-5g-modem-may-compete-with-qualcomms-snapdragon-x70.html\">Snapdragon X70</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Jeff Pu says Apple will be bringing Wi-Fi 7 to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 14 launched with Wi-Fi 6 and not Wi-Fi 6E. Apple has since brought 6E support to the iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, so we can expect Apple to bring it to the iPhone 15 lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 16 generation though we may see an even bigger update, with Wi-Fi 7 expected. Wi-Fi 7 will deliver real-world speeds of 5.8Gbps, about 60 percent faster than Wi-Fi 6E. You will need a Wi-Fi 7 router to enjoy those speeds though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>U2 chip </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>iPhone 15 is said to be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1958352/iphone-15-upgraded-uwb-chip-vision-pro.html\">getting a U2 chip to prepare for Vision Pro integration</a>. This is according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who wrote the following on Twitter: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the phone features an upgraded ultra wideband (UWB) chip it should ensure seamless integration with the Vision Pro. “The ecosystem is one of the key success factors for Vision Pro, including the integration with other Apple hardware products,” Kuo explains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The improved UWB chip many also bring additional benefits, including more accurate AirTag tracking, for example, or reduced power consumption. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"826f0ce79997aa61ad4651c6bddf3c2d4b91bb33b293de602c1df7227f8550b5","category":"Apple"}
