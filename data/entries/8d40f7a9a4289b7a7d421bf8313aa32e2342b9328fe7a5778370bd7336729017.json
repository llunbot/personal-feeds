These changes can be seen towards the end of the teardown video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple moved the front camera and Face ID components to the iPad Pro's right-side edge, which is where the new Apple Pencil Pro magnetically attaches to the device. The teardown shows some changes to the array of magnets inside the iPad Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nOverall, the new iPad Pro has a similar internal design as the previous generation. The video provides a look at the central logic board with the M4 chip, a 10,209 mAh battery with adhesive pull tabs, quad speakers, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRepair website iFixit will likely share a more in-depth teardown of the new iPad Pro soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPad Pro launched in stores and began arriving to customers on Wednesday. In addition to the M4 chip and the relocated front camera, key new features include a brighter OLED display and thinner design compared to the previous generation.
