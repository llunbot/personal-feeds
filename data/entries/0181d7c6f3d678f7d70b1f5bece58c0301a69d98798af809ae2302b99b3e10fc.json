The coalition intends to lobby lawmakers, engage with federal regulators, and support ongoing antitrust enforcement actions against Apple and Google. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe group's immediate concern is a growing legislative push to require age verification for users downloading mobile apps that may be unsuitable for minors. A law enacted in Utah in March requires app stores to verify a user's age and obtain parental consent before allowing minors to download certain applications. Additional proposals are reportedly being drafted at the federal level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe coalition's members argue that Apple and Google, as gatekeepers of the iOS <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and Google Play Store respectively, are best positioned to implement uniform age verification protocols across devices and markets. By contrast, Apple and Google have maintained that responsibility should lie with individual app developers, who are directly collecting and processing user data within their apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn recent years, Apple has introduced features aimed at limiting children's exposure to harmful content, including communication safety tools and default app restrictions for child accounts, but the company has been reluctant to assume primary responsibility for verifying user identities at the download stage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeyond age verification, the coalition aims to highlight broader concerns over Apple's app distribution practices. These include the company's 15â€“30% commission on digital transactions, mandatory use of its in-app purchase system, and restrictions on alternative app marketplaces or payment methods. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/meta-spotify-and-match-launch-lobby-coalition/\">Meta, Spotify, and Match Launch Coalition Against Apple and Google</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-spotify-and-match-launch-coalition-against-apple-and-google.2456239/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0181d7c6f3d678f7d70b1f5bece58c0301a69d98798af809ae2302b99b3e10fc","category":"Apple"}
