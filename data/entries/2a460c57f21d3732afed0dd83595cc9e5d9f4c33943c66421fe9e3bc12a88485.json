An included cook mode provides step-by-step instructions, and users can save favorite recipes for offline access.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Ambient Music</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.4 includes an Ambient Music option that can be added to Control Center. There are four different sound categories, including Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-ambient-music.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nEach category can be added to Control Center separately, and tapping one plays a random selection of sounds or music from that particular category.

The change should make it more obvious where users go to create a ‌Genmoji‌ character.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-genmoji.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Photos</h2>\r<br />\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app, there are new options to filter your library by images that were shared with you by others or by those that are not included in an album, which is useful for separating out content that you've organized into albums.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/photos-filters-ios-18-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple also added an option to view your album list by key photo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Recently Deleted section of the ‌Photos‌ app now has one-tap options to delete all photos and to recover all photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-deleted-album.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1918\" height=\"997\" />\r<br />\nIn the ‌Photos‌ Settings, there is a Show Recently Viewed &amp; Shared toggle that will show or hide the Recently Viewed and Recently Shared albums from the Utilities list.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Type to Siri</h2>\r<br />\nWhen you use Type to ‌Siri‌ to ask ‌Siri‌ a question, the keyboard is now collapsed down when ‌Siri‌ answers.
