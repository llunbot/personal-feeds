{"title":"Disney Buys Partial Stake in Epic Games for $1.5 Billion","link":"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-and-epic-games-fortnite/","date":1707434713000,"content":"\n<p>Disney:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Walt Disney Company and Epic Games will collaborate on an \nall-new games and entertainment universe that will further expand \nthe reach of beloved Disney stories and experiences. Disney will \nalso invest $1.5 billion to acquire an equity stake in Epic Games \nalongside the multiyear project. The transaction is subject to \ncustomary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to being a world-class games experience and \ninteroperating with Fortnite, the new persistent universe will \noffer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, \nshop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, \nPixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more. Players, gamers and \nfans will be able to create their own stories and experiences, \nexpress their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content \nwith each other in ways that they love. This will all be powered \nby Unreal Engine. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/12252?rc=jfy0lk&amp;shared=58ee3ce55f609abc\">Corey Weinberg, at The Information</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Disney’s $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games values the Fortnite \nmaker at $22.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said. \nThe price is about a 29% drop from where investors last valued the \ncompany less than two years ago. </p>\n\n<p>The investment makes the “Fortnite” maker one of the largest \nprivate, venture-backed companies to sell new shares at a steep \ndiscount since higher interest rates hit tech valuations. Disney’s \n$1.5 billion investment will dilute existing Epic shareholders by \n9%, the person said. The size of the investment would imply a \nroughly 7% stake in the company. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The interesting third wheel in this relationship is obviously Apple. Apple is exceptionally cozy with Disney — from the whole Steve Jobs thing with Pixar to Bob Iger appearing in last June’s WWDC keynote to help Tim Cook announce Vision Pro. Apple is not so cozy with Epic Games.</p>\n\n<p>Will this change anything on that front? If these new experiences require <em>Fortnite</em> to play, right now that rules out playing them on iPhone, iPad, or Vision Pro, because Epic Games no longer has an Apple developer account for <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/08/disney-epic\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"97dd5dc4c1f096439d40acbad6fd29ce40e7842dab8166f0d7f3f00a9f2067a2","category":"Tech"}
