In court, Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently suggested that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/ios-19-google-gemini-integration-likely/\">iOS 19 may include Google Gemini integration</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone models with Apple Intelligence have already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-iphone-chatgpt-integration/\">offered ChatGPT integration since iOS 18.2</a>. With user permission, Siri can show ChatGPT answers directly in response to questions and other prompts. ChatGPT is also an option for Apple's system-wide Writing Tools feature, allowing users to generate text and images. Google Gemini would likely have similar integration across Siri and Writing Tools, becoming a second option alongside ChatGPT.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle Gemini is already available <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729\">as an iPhone app</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence is available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models, plus select iPads and Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.6 beta testing should begin later this month. After that, Apple is expected to announce iOS 19 during its annual developers conference WWDC, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/\">kicks off Monday, June 9</a>. The first iOS 19 beta should be seeded to developers shortly after the keynote, and the software update should be released to the general public in September.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-6-ios-19/\">Apple Intelligence to Evolve in Two Ways Across iOS 18.6 and iOS 19</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-to-evolve-in-two-ways-across-ios-18-6-and-ios-19.2456543/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b572391edadc310d96a27bc9ad010397430aab5a15abca6c7a22e85fda7acbbf","category":"Apple"}
