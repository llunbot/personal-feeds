Subsequent finds at the site indicate that the structure was actually an astronomical observatory, deemed the first and largest such structure yet found, <a href=\"https://mota.gov.eg/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-2/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B3-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%83%D9%81%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AE/\">according to</a> Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.</p>\n<p>The L-shaped structure was found within a larger complex called the Temple of Buto (a later Greek name), known to the ancient Egyptians as Per-Wadjet and located east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta. It's now called Tell El Fara'in (\"Hill of the Pharaohs\"). Buto was once a sacred site dedicated to the goddess <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadjet\">Wadjet</a>, believed to be the matron and protector of lower Egypt, who took on a cobra form. Buto was well-known for its temple and the oracle of Wadjet, with an annual festival held there in her honor.</p>\n<p>There were archaeological excavations of the site in the 1960s and 1980s, revealing a palace dating back to the Second Dynasty, as well as six Greek bathhouses. An Egyptian team began fresh excavations a few years ago. In 2022, they uncovered a hall at the southwestern end of the temple, with the remains of three papyrus-shaped columns aligned on a north-south axis. They also found Â engraved stone fragments and a limestone painting of a bird's head wearing a white crown within two feathers.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/archaeologists-found-an-ancient-egyptian-observatory/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/archaeologists-found-an-ancient-egyptian-observatory/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"22f37d2835668cd56c5c60f2589b9b4639429744520a94a6b65af7b8894183ce","category":"Tech"}
