This isn’t an aero road bike, and it certainly isn’t a light-gravel race bike. Instead, the new Chapter 2 Rira is a modern, fast &amp; light all-rounder road bike, getting back to the basics so you can simply enjoy the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it comes at the same time as a new, even more narrow 1-piece aero carbon Mana5 handlebar cockpit that will help almost any road rider get more aero to go faster…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Chapter 2 Rira carbon all-rounder (all-)road bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Chapter 2 Rira carbon all-rounder all-road bike, sample build\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-jpg.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_complete-bike-sample-build-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Chapter 2)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 2 founder Michael Pryde describes the new Rira as a “<em>brand-new All-Road Racing chassis designed to elevate your riding experience</em>“. But ‘all-road’ might be a bit of a stretch, considering many modern aero road race bikes have the same tire clearance these days. That’s not really a dig at this new Rira, though. It’s more a comment on the fact that many new road bikes have become more versatile thanks to bigger tires – bringing lower rolling resistance, improved rider comfort, and even enhanced grip on all surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_teaser-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_teaser-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Chapter 2 Rira carbon all-rounder all-road bike, teaser\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_teaser-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_teaser-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_teaser-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_teaser-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_teaser-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the new Rira looks like a great all-rounder road bike with plenty of tire clearance. With room for up to a 32mm rear tire and up to a 34mm front tire (claimed <em>practical</em> clearance), you certainly can ride this bike beyond classic smooth tarmac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-up-close-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-up-close-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Chapter 2 Rira carbon all-rounder all-road bike, angled detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-up-close-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-up-close-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-up-close-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-up-close-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-up-close-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Rira replaces <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chapter2-toa-refines-road-gravel-into-all-new-integrated-aero-all-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2’s Toa</a>, as their ‘all-road’ all-rounder. Tire clearance is touted as a big versatility boost over the Toa, but technically only the fork actually offers more clearance according to ISO definitions. In reality though,  lighter weight is also a real benefit. At 945g for a size M, the new Chapter 2 Rira isn’t incredibly light. But it does save 150g off its predecessor, plus 30g saved on the new fork, as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-rear-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-rear-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Chapter 2 Rira carbon all-rounder all-road bike, angled rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-rear-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-rear-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-rear-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-rear-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_angled-rear-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Rira returns to a conventional seatstay layout &amp; classic round 27.2mm seatpost, the new bike does feature a few aerodynamic optimizations. A new hourglass aero headtube and flat-backed seattube help minimize drag, while adding both stiffness and rider comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Chapter 2 says they focused on making the Rira stiffer, boosting headtube stiffness 22% &amp; bottom bracket stiffness by 12% over the Toa for improved pedaling &amp; handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All-new geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Chapter 2 Rira carbon all-rounder all-road bike, new geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-jpg.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-297x162.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-1536x838.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-120x65.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-768x419.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Chapter-2-Rira-carbon-all-rounder-all-road-bike_geometry-2048x1117.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Chapter 2 Rira gets completely revamped geometry, developed to provide quick but consistent all-surface handling for all rider sizes, even with bigger tire clearance. What that means is that the new bikes now feature size-specific bottom bracket drop, and 2 size-specific fork offsets. The range of frame Stack increases, especially to better fit smaller riders. And even though chainstay length increased a couple of millimeters for more tire clearance, the bikes get incrementally shorter overall wheelbase lengths to keep the agility &amp; maneuverability of the Rira’s predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Mana5 narrow integrated cockpit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Narrow Chapter 2 Mana5 1-piece carbon road bike handlebar stem cockpit, aero dimpled detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_up-close-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rira’s Toa predecessor actually debuted Chapter 2’s 1-piece carbon Mana integrated cockpit. And now in its fifth iteration, the new Mana5 is lighter, more aero, more integrated, and a lot narrower. Plus, now Chapter 2 offers the Mana5 in quite a bit more sizes, so more cyclists can get exactly the cockpit fit they want to get more aero and more comfortable to go faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Narrow Chapter 2 Mana5 1-piece carbon road bike handlebar stem cockpit, front view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Narrow-Chapter-2-Mana5-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-handlebar-stem-cockpit_front-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new aero dimpled handlebar+stem combo again features ~25mm of flare to each side to make room for your arms in the drops, while keeping the bar narrow at the hoods. Chapter 2 goes even narrower with the Mana5, now having 5 bar widths as narrow as 35.5cm at your brake hoods (355, 366, 377, 388 &amp; 399mm center-center). They are officially sized by width at the drops – 405, 416, 427, 438 &amp; 449mm center-center. There are also 5 effective stem lengths, depending on bar width (80, 90, 100, 110 &amp; 120mm). Ultimately 12 size combos are on offer, with weights claimed around 330g (<em>100x427mm</em>) for the Toray UD carbon cockpit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, the Mana5 cockpit features fully integrated cable routing, and underside mounting points for a direct mount out-front GPS holder (not included). But it is also backward compatible with all round 1 1/8″ steerer forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
