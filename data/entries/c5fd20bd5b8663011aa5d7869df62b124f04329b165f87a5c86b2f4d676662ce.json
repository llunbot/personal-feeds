With the launch of iOS 15, however, Apple has added the ability to rate and review its own apps just like all the others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/&amp;xcust=1-1-539984-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">As spotted by 9to5Mac</a>, all of the Apple apps available <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/apple/id284417353&amp;xcust=1-1-539984-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">in the App Store can be rated now</a>, and users have already expressed their feelings on them. The highest-rated is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facetime/id1110145091&amp;xcust=1-1-539984-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">FaceTime with a 4.3-star rating</a>, but many have a rating less than three stars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Activity:</strong> 3.6 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Books:</strong> 3.6 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Calculator:</strong> 3.5 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Calendar: </strong>2.9 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compass:</strong> 3.8 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contacts:</strong> 3.2 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FaceTime:</strong> 4.3 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Files:</strong> 3.3 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find My: </strong>3.9 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Home:</strong> 3.5 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iTunes Store:</strong> 3.3 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mail:</strong> 2.8 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maps:</strong> 3 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Measure:</strong> 3.1 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Music: </strong>3.6 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>News:</strong> 2.3 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Notes: </strong>3.6 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Podcasts:</strong> 2 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reminders:</strong> 3.1 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stocks:</strong> 3.8 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong> 4.1 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TV:</strong> 3.3 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Watch:</strong> 3.5 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Weather:</strong> 3.7 stars</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most apps have less than 100 ratings, but the early reviews aren’t great. While there are plenty of five-star positive reviews, numerous negative reviews are peppered with comments like “C’mon Apple you’re better than this,” “Awful update,” and “Terrible release,” as users express their discontent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear why Apple decided to open up the stock iOS apps to ratings in the App Store, but it could be related to the recent changes to the developer terms in the App Store. Over the past several weeks, Apple has relaxed the rules of the App Store and a ruling in the Epic trial and could be forced to allow apps to allow apps to directly link to external payment sources.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c5fd20bd5b8663011aa5d7869df62b124f04329b165f87a5c86b2f4d676662ce","category":"Apple"}
