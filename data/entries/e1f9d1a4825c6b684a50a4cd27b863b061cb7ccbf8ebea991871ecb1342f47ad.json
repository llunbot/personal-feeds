Delta <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688\">launched Wednesday</a> as one of the first officially approved iOS apps to emulate Nintendo consoles from the NES through the N64 and the Game Boy through the Nintendo DS (though unofficial options have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/nessnes-emulator-sneaks-into-ios-app-store/\">snuck through in the past</a>).</p>\n<p>Delta is an outgrowth of developer Riley Testut's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/10/ios-8-1-plugs-security-hole-that-made-it-easy-to-install-emulators/\">earlier sideloadable GBA4iOS project</a>, which recently had its own<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/apple-removes-the-first-ios-game-boy-emulator-released-under-new-app-store-rules/\"> unauthorized clone removed from the App Store</a>. Before Wednesday, iOS users could load Delta onto their devices only through <a href=\"https://altstore.io/\">AltStore</a>, an iOS marketplace that used a Developer Mode workaround to sideload apps from a self-hosted server. European users can now get that AltStore directly on their iOS devices (for a small 1.50 euro/year fee), while North American users can simply <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688\">download Delta for free from the iOS App Store</a>, with no ads or user tracking to boot.</p>\n<p>All that history means Delta is far from a slapdash app quickly thrown together to take advantage of Apple's new openness to emulation. The app is obviously built with iOS in mind and already integrates some useful features designed for the mobile ecosystem. While there are some updates we'd like to see in the future, this represents a good starting point for where Apple-approved game emulation can go on iOS.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018249#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018249&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e1f9d1a4825c6b684a50a4cd27b863b061cb7ccbf8ebea991871ecb1342f47ad","category":"Tech"}
