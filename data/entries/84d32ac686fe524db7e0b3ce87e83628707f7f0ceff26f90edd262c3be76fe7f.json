With the Tensor chip, Google says that voice commands, translation, captioning, and dictation will be much improved.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>We made a chip!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Pixel6</a> is powered by our first ever smartphone SoC: meet Google Tensor<br /><br />(5/13) <a href=\"https://t.co/0Kts53Tfqm\">pic.twitter.com/0Kts53Tfqm</a></p>— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1422228884121133062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch full-screen display with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the 6.7-inch Pixel 6 Pro has a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate.

The Pixel 6 Pro is equipped with wide, ultra wide, and telephoto camera lenses, and the telephoto lens has 4x optical zoom capabilities.
