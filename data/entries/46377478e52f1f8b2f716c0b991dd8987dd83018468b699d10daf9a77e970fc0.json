{"title":"Mandate Vaccinations, Not Masks","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/opinion/covid-vaccine-delta-variant.html","date":1627582829000,"content":"\n<p>Aaron E. Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, in a guest column for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many may read the C.D.C.’s continued focus on masking and\ndistancing as an acknowledgment that the vaccines don’t work well\nenough. Leaning heavily on masking and distancing is what we did\nwhen we didn’t have vaccinations. Today, such recommendations are\nless likely to succeed because they are more likely to be followed\nby those already primed to listen — the vaccinated — and to be\nfought and ignored by those who aren’t.</p>\n\n<p>Hospitalizations and deaths are rising in some areas not because\nsomeone didn’t wear a mask at the ballgame. They’re occurring\nbecause too many people are not immunized.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I’ve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/opinion/covid-vaccine-mandate.html\">advocated</a> vaccine mandates. I don’t understand\nhow we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s German Lopez, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/7/28/22594637/vaccine-mandates-covid-19-masks-delta-variants\">making the same case at Vox</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an\nobviously smart decision. Mask mandates <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19\">work</a>, and for most of\n2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread\nof Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term\nsolution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the\nworld could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.</p>\n\n<p>Now those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of\nsummer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a\nmask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and\nfederal governments — should consider mandating something else\nfirst: vaccination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Asking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/vaccinated-america-breaking-point-anti-vaxxers/619539/\">The backlash is growing</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/29/carroll-mandate-vaccinations\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"46377478e52f1f8b2f716c0b991dd8987dd83018468b699d10daf9a77e970fc0","category":"Tech"}
