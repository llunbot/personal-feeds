Now a new rumor may have spoiled one of the last remaining secrets, claiming Apple’s high-end phone will have a new high-end name, too: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Apple Insider’s Andrew O’Hara on X (formerly Twitter), “Apple will indeed use the ‘iPhone 15 Ultra’ moniker for the plus-sized pro phone.” It’s long been reported that Apple’s largest pro phone will have a new periscope lens for better telephoto photos. In a follow-up post, O’Hara says the zoom camera could be 10X (compared to 3X on the iPhone 14 Pro phones), though most rumors claim it will be 5X or 6X.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Here’s a late Friday tidbit I’ve heard for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone15?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2036956-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">#iPhone15</a>. Multiple sources have told me Apple will indeed use the “iPhone 15 Ultra” monicker for the plus-sized pro phone. This was an early rumor that got backpedaled. Most have since referred to it as iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>— Andrew O'Hara (@Andrew_OSU) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/Andrew_OSU/status/1692702380456853619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2036956-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">August 19, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, it’s not clear what will differentiate the iPhone 15 Ultra from the iPhone 15 Pro other than the screen size. Both phones are expected to adopt a new titanium frame as well as an Action button, both features introduced with the Apple Watch Ultra. The phones will also reportedly bring faster charging and data transfers thanks to a new USB-C port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After unveiling the Apple Watch Ultra last year, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1524265/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-camera-weight-zoom-price.html\">early rumors claimed</a> Apple would introduce the iPhone 15 Ultra to replace the iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, Mark Gurman reported earlier this year that the Ultra would be a 2024 release instead.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e6f8fd2dab0ba646241552bb17b2a914c467d4976493ffaf6cb5231ea9c994e4","category":"Apple"}
