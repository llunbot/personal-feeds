Hawaii is not yet showing up as an option for all iPhone users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first announced this feature in September 2021, but it has been slow to roll out, and the digital IDs can only be used at a very limited number of locations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor example, the IDs can be used at select TSA checkpoints within select U.S. airports:<ul><li>Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Denver International Airport (DEN)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG)</li>\r<br />\n<li>John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH)</li></ul>Apple says travelers should refer to TSA checkpoint signage to confirm availability of the feature, and the <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/digital-id/map\">TSA's website offers more details</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's website says that the digital IDs in the Wallet app can also be used to show proof of age or identity at \"select bars, concerts, festivals, and more,\" but the company does not list any specific locations, and adoption is far from widespread.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a press release earlier this month, Apple reiterated that iPhone users \"do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2022, Apple said the six additional states listed below would \"soon\" allow residents to add their driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app, but over two years have passed and none of these states support the feature yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThose six states:<ul><li>Connecticut</li>\r<br />\n<li>Iowa</li>\r<br />\n<li>Kentucky</li>\r<br />\n<li>Mississippi</li>\r<br />\n<li>Oklahoma</li>\r<br />\n<li>Utah</li></ul>Apple's website has a <a href=\"https://learn.wallet.apple/id\">page with more details about the digital IDs</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/iphone-wallet-app-ids-seventh-state/\">iPhone Driver's Licenses in Wallet App Rolling Out in Seventh U.S. State</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-drivers-licenses-in-wallet-app-rolling-out-in-seventh-u-s-state.2434606/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c3abf66fecda33db7767bc6be785ab0e279ea7665c3ac82a5135ceacb8861407","category":"Apple"}
