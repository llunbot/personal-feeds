This all suggests the chip is some kind of M3 Pro, like the kind you'd find in a 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro or a high-end Mac mini; the current base model M2 Pro uses six high-performance CPU cores, four high-efficiency cores, and 16 GPU cores. We can only guess at the specs of the regular M3, the M3 Max, or the M3 Ultra.</p>\n<p>Though Apple has (mostly) ditched Intel, the two companies have taken a similar approach to improving their processors' performance in recent years: lean on architectural upgrades and small clock speed boosts to improve single-threaded performance on the big CPU cores while adding an increasing number of small high-efficiency cores to bolster multi-threaded performance for pro-level workloads that can use every CPU core you throw at them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939234#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939234&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e6362395a62d117972ad068deaba2908aad5a418961f9ec399ac66820c87dac","category":"Tech"}
