And at this price, it’s hard to find anything better: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLHCWH55/\">Amazon is selling the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $699</a>, a savings of $300 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the same MacBook that sold for $1,199 just a couple of months ago. It’s got an impressive 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, an incredibly thin and light design with an excellent keyboard, all-day battery life, silent fan-less operation, and a good selection of expansion, including fast-charging with MagSafe, a headphone jack, and two Thunderbolt ports. And with an M2 and 16GB of RAM, it’s good for years of Apple Intelligence and macOS updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our 4.5-star review, we praised the Air’s “absolutely excellent processor,” and our opinion hasn’t changed two generations later. So go grab this deal before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\n\n<span>Grab an M2 MacBook Air for $300 off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2630918/even-the-m4-macbook-air-cant-beat-this-insane-699-m2-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c0b0c2fd66b897c6bc436a6261ea29150672a8fc9bc6bdc22a729dbb782e38cf","category":"Apple"}
