With four mountain stages and around 20,000m of climbing still to come in a brutal final week through the Alps, the Giro d’Italia is moving ever closer to its finale in Rome next Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Isaac del Toro continues to lead <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">the Giro</a>, now with a gap of 1min 20sec over Simon Yates in second place and 1min 26sec to Del Toro’s teammate Juan Ayuso in third. In the other classifications, there’s been little change. Mads Pedersen has a huge 100-point lead in the points classification, as does Lorenzo Fortunato in the climber’s standings, while race leader Del Toro also holds the <em>maglia bianca</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we gear up for a final week stacked with big-name climbs, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2025\">including the Mortirolo and the Colle delle Finestre</a>, let’s round up another bunch of our winners and losers of the Giro d’Italia so far.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: EF Education-EasyPost</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216848571-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Grand Tour stage victories are usually few and far between for EF Education-EasyPost. This week, however, the American squad bagged two stages courtesy of two of their marquee riders Richard Carapaz and Kasper Asgreen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carapaz, his stage win felt like a real high point for himself and the team’s management, who signed the Ecuadorian up two years ago as a Grand Tour leader. His aggressive style paid off on the rolling stage, giving us glimpses of his former Grand Tour-winning form to take his first Giro stage since that overall victory in 2019. Although EF have historically struggled to win on the Grand Tour stage, this victory marks a fifth Giro in a row where the squad have taken a stage victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the floodgates open, Kasper Asgreen weathered the storm in Slovenia to take a victory from the break on Stage 14. The former Tour of Flanders winner struggled through the Spring Classics, but now he’s back to winning ways, albeit in a different scenario to the one EF may have imagined when they signed him. This seems to be a trend for Asgreen, as his stage win at the 2023 Tour de France also came on the back of another disappointing Classics campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stages aren’t the only thing keeping the team content during the second week of the Giro. From where we’re at right now, Richard Carapaz has a strong chance of making it on the podium. He’s been one of the most impressive GC riders so far, always willing to make an attack in the mountains, and never once missing a crucial split. As a result he sits just 2min 07sec behind Del Toro and less than a minute away from the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'join us and discover the world's best places to ride, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Simon Yates</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216301641-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Who’d have thought that Simon Yates would be in second place in the GC on the final rest day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly chipping away at this Giro, the Brit has somehow slipped into the provisional runners-up spot, just 1min 20sec behind Del Toro. The Visma-Lease a Bike leader, who is scheduled to go to the Tour de France this summer too,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-profile\"> has flown under the radar</a> so far in this race, having not made any big attacks in the mountains. In this kind of race of attrition, it’s perhaps not a bad thing that he hasn’t caught headlines yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real stroke of genius from Simon Yates, or more his teammates, came on Stage 14’s messy arrival into Nova Goricia. His colleagues pushed on, carrying a reduced peloton that included Yates, Bernal, Carapaz and Del Toro ahead of a considerable contingent of GC favourites caught out behind. Understandably, <span>Visma-Lease a Bike were strongly criticised</span><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\"> </a>for forcing a split after a crash. It’s somewhat of an uncodified poor practice for teams to carry on racing in the aftermath of a mass pile-up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this, Yates jumped up to second place, just over a minute behind Del Toro. This is the best place he has been in the overall rankings of a Grand Tour on the final rest day since the 2021 Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to rain on his parade, but Yates is a bit hit or miss in the final week of racing. Even on that aforementioned Giro, he slipped down to third in the final week. Perhaps with more experience under his belt and a bigger-budget team behind him, he could defend that podium spot, or even move closer to Del Toro’s pink jersey. Don’t forget, there’s a chance for poetic justice when the race hits the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\">Colle delle Finestre</a> on Stage 20, banishing his memories from that tumultuous day in 2018.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-podium-2025\">The fight for the Giro d’Italia podium is wide open</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/isaac-del-toro-2025-giro-ditalia\">Can Isaac del Toro win the 2025 Giro d’Italia?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-predictions-2025\">Cyclist’s Giro d’Italia 2025 predictions</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2025\">The key climbs of the Giro d’Italia 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Isaac del Toro</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216227449-scaled.webp\" alt=\"UAE Team Emirates XRG's Mexican rider Isaac Del Toro wearing the pink jersey of overall leader (Maglia Rosa), waits before the start of the 15th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race of 219kms from Fiume Veneto to Asiago on May 25, 2025.

He made the crucial split on Stage 14’s crash-littered finale too, helping to distance himself from the likes of Roglič, Tiberi and Ayuso. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mexican was mightily impressive on Stage 15, following every move up the Monte Grappa with this overwhelming ease. Through the week, he’s had this air of Pogačar about him – and that’s not just his unwavering commitment to the pink bib shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This second week was always going to be a big test of character for Del Toro, who is riding just his second Grand Tour. He’s passed his first week in the <em>maglia rosa</em> with flying colours, having only extended his gap on the road to his rivals and, importantly, his teammate Juan Ayuso. The Spaniard has shown some signs of weakness through the second week, while Del Toro has consistently been towards the front of affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The betting markets have responded, narrowing his odds to become the favourite to win the Corsa Rosa this time next week. The team have said that they’ll try to defend his jersey, backing Del Toro over Ayuso while he’s in pink, and with more rivals falling victim to their own time losses and misfortune, Del Toro really is in the driving seat at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: The GC battle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216967837-970x646.webp\" alt=\"ASIAGO, ITALY - MAY 25: (L-R) Richard Carapaz of Ecuador and Team EF Education - EasyPost, Isaac Del Toro of Mexico and Team UAE Team Emirates - XRG - Pink Leader Jersey and Egan Bernal of Colombia and Team INEOS Grenadiers compete during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 15 a 219km stage from Fiume Veneto to Asiago / #UCIWT / on May 25, 2025 in Asiago, Italy.

Every stage this week was engaging, even if the profiles looked a bit lacklustre on paper. In all honesty, the only dud for viewers last week was Stage 12, won by one of last week’s losers Olav Kooij.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GC snakes and ladders have already kicked off, and last week served strange and unpredictable storylines, from a mass pile-up in Nova Gorica to long-range moves on the Monte Grappa and the strange team dynamic at UAE Team Emirates XRG. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kudos for this have to go to Richard Carapaz and Egan Bernal, who have been aggressive throughout this second week of racing. In particular, Ineos Grenadiers have been very keen to throw the cat among the pigeons. On Stages 11, 13 and 15, the team teed up long-range Bernal moves, sometimes from well over 50km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Colombian still lingers towards the lower echelon of the top ten, blighted by a crash during the time-trial. However there’s a real intent to climb up the rankings in the final week through brute force from his team, who will be hoping to catch UAE Team Emirates XRG off-guard as they weigh up their own leadership dilemma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it stands, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-podium-2025\">the top five in this Giro is really up in the air</a>. Anyone, from Richard Carapaz to Egan Bernal, Derek Gee or Damiano Caruso could move up the standings with a couple of good days in the mountains this week. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

week in the losers bracket, it feels as though Primož Roglič might have already lost the 2025 Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite taking a healthy bag of time on Stage 10’s time-trial, Roglič’s GC positivity didn’t last long. If anything, he didn’t look like himself last week at all. He missed the opportunity to chase bonus seconds at the Red Bull KM and on the finales of days like Stage 11 and 13. On tailor-made approaches like Stage 13 to Vicenza, Roglič was well and truly out of the frame when he was expected to be fighting for the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These disappointing results were heightened by a major time loss on Stage 14, as he found himself caught out once again by a crash. That said, Stage 15 the following day really felt like the last nail in the coffin for Roglič’s pink jersey bid. He cracked on the final climb to Dorí, unable to follow the accelerations led by Ineos Grenadiers, UAE Team Emirates and Visma-Lease a Bike. Instead, we soon caught sight of him dangling off the back with the likes of Tom Pidcock, well over a minute down from the <em>maglia rosa</em> group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, his Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team appeared weak. Giulio Pelizzari has definitely earned his paycheck in the Giro as he’s dragged the Slovenian through the entire race, but Dani Martínez is still missing in action, while the likes of Jan Tratnik and Giovanni Aleotti have been rarely visible at the front of the peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After losing three minutes to Del Toro this week, Roglič needs to move mountains if he wants to win this Giro in Rome. Honestly, it’s hard to even imagine a podium finish if his downward turn continues into the final week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Wet weather crashes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216842176-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What would the Giro be without its fair share of wet-weather crashes? Well, this week, the slippery roads reared their ugly head once again, forcing crashes to blight the GC on stages that seemed fairly unremarkable at first glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday’s time-trial both Primož Roglič and Egan Bernal suffered off-screen slips on the wet course. Although Roglič’s fall occurred during a pre-race recon ride and didn’t result in any direct time losses, it gave him yet another bruise to deal with after a taxing opening week in which he had already crashed on the gravelled stage. In Bernal’s case, he suffered his blow while the clock was ticking, leading to an extra 30 second time loss. He was fit enough to soldier on, but the losses would cost the 2021 Giro champion a couple of places in the overall standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these two crashes played their part in the GC mechanics, they didn’t come close to the impact of Stage 14’s messy finale in the Slovenian town of Nova Gorica. A pile-up at around the 20km to go mark saw most of the peloton halted by a spill close to the front of the peloton, ripping the race into several groups. As the fallers picked themselves up, Visma-Lease a Bike continued to put on the pace, sending many to brush off the unwritten rule book on crash etiquette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the race organisers enforced the time gaps over the finish line, meaning that several of the big players in the GC would lose minutes in the overall standings. Through little fault of their own, Primož Roglič, Egan Bernal, Juan Ayuso and Thymen Arensman all lost a minute in the overall standings, while Antonio Tiberi lost a hefty two minutes on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ripple effect of the crash may have been the main problem, but for Giulio Ciccone, the fall forced him to abandon the race overnight after having lost sixteen minutes struggling to the stage finish. After a successful run in the GC up to this point, the Lidl-Trek leader would put an end to one of his best GC bids to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Inter-team dynamics</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215627030-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Pink Jersey UAE Team Emirates XRG's Mexican rider Isaac Del Toro poses with teammate UAE Team Emirates XRG's Spanish rider Juan Ayuso before the 11th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race of 186kms from Viareggio to Castelnovo ne' Monti on May 21, 2025.

However, as the second week unravelled, many people criticised the strange tactics employed by the team. Although they still remain in pole position to win the race, their two-headed approach has stirred up some unwanted attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Tel Toro’s healthy GC lead, the team seemed to be all-in for Ayuso in the GC. In the mountains, he’s the one positioned at the end of the mountain train, and when he’s in danger, the team drops back to support him instead of drilling a possible advantage for their pink jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayuso has suffered far more bumps than Del Toro after the opening two weeks. The Spaniard lost time on the gravel, and the stitches required to help the wound would rip during last Tuesday’s time-trial. Later in the week, he bled out more time, missing out on bonus second sprints and failing to respond to early attacks launched by the likes of Bernal and Carapaz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Stage 15, however, there was a real chance for UAE Team Emirates to wrap the Giro up when Richard Carapaz launched an attack up the Monte Grappa. Del Toro followed, pushing the gap out to around 30 seconds until UAE Team Emirates clunked into gear behind and chased them down. Yes, they wanted Ayuso to remain in the ring for pink, but it would have been an ideal chance to catch the likes of Simon Yates out, creating a move that could have enhanced Del Toro’s lead in the GC towards the two-minute marker and reduced the ring of potential winners down to just Carapaz and Del Toro himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, with Del Toro in uncharted territory as race leader, it’s understandable that UAE Team Emirates play this race as conservatively as possible for Ayuso in case of any final week losses from Del Toro. At this point though, it’s hard to comprehend the reasons behind placing Del Toro on a leash in the mountains when he could add an extra time buffer ahead of the extreme tests in the final week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Antonio Tiberi</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216096760-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Bahrain Victorious' Italian rider Antonio Tiberi (C) rides after crossing the finish line of the 14th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race of 195kms from Treviso in Italy to Nova Gorica in Slovenia on May 24, 2025.

A strong time-trial and bolstered team support had him lodged in the fight for a top five finish at this year’s Corsa Rosa, however the Italian was yet another victim of Saturday’s crash-filled stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Roglič, Ayuso and Bernal, Tiberi lost a significant two minutes as a result of the crashes – as well as some skin on his left thigh. This threw him down the standings from third to eighth. All his gains in the TT were almost completely cancelled out by the incident, leaving him on the back foot coming into the final week. The 23-year-old is more of a Steady Eddy in the GC. By this, I mean he doesn’t climb with the same explosivity as Bernal, Carapaz or Del Toro. Instead, he’s likely to stick to the wheels and consolidate his position during the upcoming mountain stages instead of attacking to gain time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, the Italian has now been overtaken in the standings by teammate Damiano Caruso, who is no stranger to cracking the top five at the Giro d’Italia. Although Tiberi came into this race as the out-and-out leader for Bahrain Victorious, it’s looking like he’s going to have to tussle with Caruso for leadership duties now. The Sicilian, who just signed a new contract with Bahrain, has always gone well in the final week of racing, so keep an eye out for some more internal struggles towards the top of the overall standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2025-week-two\">Winners and losers of the second week of the 2025 Giro d’Italia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6b3870ba3bed2f5b158594c56726ce6ab22efb540630592f1aef768f59749903","category":"Cycling"}
