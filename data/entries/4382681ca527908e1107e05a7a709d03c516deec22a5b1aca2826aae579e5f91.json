Its size and resolution make it a direct competitor to Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Studio Display</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BenQ PD2730S: Specifications</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Size</strong></td><td>27 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Glass front</strong></td><td>Nano Matte Panel</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Native resolution</strong></td><td>5120 by 2880</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Panel type/Backlight</strong></td><td>IPS/LED backlight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Response time</strong></td><td>5 ms</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Contrast ratio</strong></td><td>2000:1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td>24Hz to 60Hz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color depth</strong></td><td>10-bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>400 nits</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimensions with stand (horizontal)</strong></td><td>Highest height: 22.7 by 24.2 by 9.5 inches (577.6 by 614 by 242.1mm) Lowest height: 16.8 by 24.2 by 9.5 inches (427.6 by 614 by 242.1mm)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight with stand</strong></td><td>18.12 lbs (8.22 kg)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>BenQ PD2730S: Design and build</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PD2730S is a well-built, good-looking display. It is encased in plastic, with the back in white and the bezels and the underneath panel in dark gray. It doesn’t feel cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When unpacking the display, there’s a warning label attached to the upper right corner that tells users not to peel away the coating of the display. There’s a very narrow gap between the display and the case and at the corners, the display panel is exposed. Someone might be tempted to start picking at the corner to peel what may look like a protective packaging overlay. But there is no packaging layer, thus the warning label. Leave it alone!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrow gap runs along the top and sides of the whole display. During this review, I moved the display around several times and perhaps handled it an unusual amount compared to a typical user. That resulted in tiny bits of lint and other bits getting caught in these crevices. I was able to clean the gap by inserting some masking tape into it (double-sided tape would make the task quicker), but I can’t say if this is a long-term consideration for this display. It certainly does not affect the display’s performance; it’s a matter of aesthetics. At the bottom where the display panel and case meet, the seam is sealed.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"BenQ PD2730S top corner\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-top-edge.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The small gap between the case and the display seems like an odd design decision.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>BenQ PD2730S: Display stand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BenQ includes a plastic stand that offers -5 to 20 degrees of tilt, 30 degrees of swivel left or right, and 150 mm of height adjustment. The display can also pivot 90 degrees but turning it counterclockwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The base of the stand is rather large, measuring 11 by 8.5 inches (28 by 21.6 cm), but it does provide stability for the 27-inch display. If you’re using the PD2730S with a Mac mini, you could pace it on the base and it’ll look right at home.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"BenQ PD2730S stand\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730S-stand.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The BenQ PD2730S’s stand is a stable base.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>BenQ PD2730S: Ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PD2730S has the following ports on the back:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>HDMI 2.1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DisplayPort 1.4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thunderbolt 4 (90W Power Delivery, DisplayPort Alt Mode, data)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Thunderbolt 4 (15W Power Delivery)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C (USB 3.2 Gen 2)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>The following ports are under the bottom edge of the PD2730S:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>3.5 mm audio jack</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 USB-A (USB 3.2 Gen 2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-A (USB 3.2 Gen 2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C (USB 3.2 Gen 2)</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI or Thunderbolt/USB-C can be used to connect to a Mac, but if you want to be able to use any of the display’s USB ports and the audio jack, the display needs to connect via Thunderbolt/USB-C (it’s labeled with a laptop icon on the display).

The detail it produces is sharp and satisfying; I used the display with an M4 MacBook Pro, which has a mini-LED panel (what Apple calls Liquid Retina XDR) and it looks nice, but the PD2730S is much crisper. The colors produced by the PD2730S are great, too. BenQ promotes the PD2730S as a display that’s “always accurate” and has “consistent colors” thanks to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.benq.com/en-us/campaign/aqcolor.html\">AQColor</a> technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BenQ also offers two software utilities for adjusting color. The <a href=\"https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/software/display-colortalk.html\">Display ColorTalk</a> app helps you set up your MacBook and the PD2730S so that the colors match between the two as closely as possible. The <a href=\"https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/software/palette-master-ultimate.html\">Palette Master Ultimate</a> app works with hardware calibrators and can be used to create custom color profiles. Both apps are free and helpful to photographers, designers, and anyone else who deals with colors on a professional level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 400 nits, the PD2730S isn’t as bright as Apple’s Studio Display (600 nits) or the Pro Display XDR (500 nits standard; 1000 nits sustained full‑screen or 1600 nits peak HDR). I didn’t have issues with the brightness, but it’s something to consider based on your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BenQ PD2730S: Hotkey Puck G3</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BenQ includes its Hotkey Puck G3, which is a Bluetooth dial that can be used to quickly change the PD2730S’s settings. For example, if you need to change the color profile, you can assign a profile to the dial and use it to switch between them. It can also be used instead of the underside controls to access the display’s built-in settings. If your workflow involves switching color profiles, changing inputs, and modifying display settings frequently, the Hotkey Puck G3 offers a way to make these changes almost instantly. It’s a great device that can help maintain your sanity. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"BenQ Hotkey Puck G3\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BenQ-Hotkey-Puck-G3.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Hotkey Puck G3 is used to quickly switch color profiles.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hotkey Puck G3 requires a pair of AAA batteries, which aren’t included. I wasn’t able to test how long the battery will last.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BenQ PD2730S: Built-in controls and Display Pilot 2 software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The on-screen controls are accessible through buttons and a navigation joystick on the underside of the display. These controls include the color mode, brightness, sharpness, volume for the built-in speakers, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"BenQ Display Pilot 2\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-display-pilot-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"BenQ Display Colortalk\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-display-colortalk.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"BenQ PD2730 color mode onscreen display\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/benq-PD2730-color-mode-onscreen-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install the BenQ Display Pilot 2 software, you probably won’t have to use the on-screen controls much, because Display Pilot 2 has most of the same controls. After installation, Display Pilot 2 can be accessed through an icon on the Mac’s menu bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BenQ PD2730S: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PD2730S is $2,000, which includes a stand, the Hotkey Puck G3 (two AAA batteries not included), a Thunderbolt 4 cable, and a power cable. If you want to use HDMI, you need to provide your own cable. In the U.S. the display includes a three-year warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the BenQ PD2730S 5K Designer Monitor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Graphics professionals will find the BenQ PD2730S a vital tool for production work. It offers 5K resolution and produces top-notch image quality. It also includes several helpful software tools as well as the Hotkey Puck G3 to adjust to your needs. It’s priced lower than Apple’s 27-inch, 5K Studio Display, which has a few features the PD2730S lacks (a built-in 12MP Center Stage webcam, a more robust speaker system, and a three-microphone array), but the PD2730S is a better display for professional work that demands graphical accuracy. Users looking for a general-purpose display should give the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2535315/benq-ma270u-review.html\">BenQ MA270U</a> a look; it’s not as high-end as the PD2730S, but it’s more than half the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for more options from BenQ and other brands, check out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668700/best-mac-monitors-displays.html\">Macworld’s best picks for Mac displays</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4382681ca527908e1107e05a7a709d03c516deec22a5b1aca2826aae579e5f91","category":"Apple"}
