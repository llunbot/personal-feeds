In particular, the two have blamed the mercury-containing vaccine preservative, thimerosal, despite <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15342856/\">numerous</a> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11331700/\">studies</a> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595043/\">finding no link</a>. Thimerosal was largely abandoned from vaccine formulations in 2001 out of an abundance of caution.</p>\n<p>In 2011, an investigation by the Maryland State Board of Physicians found that the Geiers were misdiagnosing autistic children and treating them with potent hormone therapies in a treatment they dubbed the \"Lupron Protocol.\" Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license. David Geier, who has no medical or scientific background and holds only a bachelor's degree, was disciplined for practicing medicine without a license.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-quack-hired-by-rfk-jr-has-started-work-at-the-health-department/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-quack-hired-by-rfk-jr-has-started-work-at-the-health-department/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b074fd3af19310f7f9fa83976156d6b50985bf97ae441e34b31ec32f56193727","category":"Tech"}
