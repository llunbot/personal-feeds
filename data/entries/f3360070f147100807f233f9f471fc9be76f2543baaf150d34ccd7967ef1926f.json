A New Zealand postman who put in a year of before-and-after-work training to make the ride happen. At 43 years old, Fleck completed the journey on a steel-framed bike, relying on a humble support van for time checks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Lachlan Morton Smashes 648km Record in a Single Day van\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lachlan-Morton-Smashes-648km-Record-in-a-Single-Day-van-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But for Lachlan, this was never just about the numbers.<em> “This wasn’t just chasing a new record; it was chasing a legend,” he said. “</em>A pure test.

The ride between these two cities is no small feat, and the legacy of those who have tackled it should be told in full.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telling this story, one name was overlooked—Brian Lambert.
