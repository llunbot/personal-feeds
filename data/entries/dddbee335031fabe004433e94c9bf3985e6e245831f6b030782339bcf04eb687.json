{"title":"A Long Lost Never-Published DF Post From 2014","link":"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/01/lefsetz","date":1749324567000,"content":"\n<p>I don’t use the web interface to <a href=\"https://movabletype.org/\">Movable Type</a>, my moribund-but-works-just-great CMS, very often. But I was using it today and noticed something odd. Next to the small-text metadata that says I’ve written 35,086 entries in total, it said I had one draft. One. I don’t use the drafts feature in Movable Type — my drafts are stored locally as text files in BBEdit or unpublished posts in MarsEdit. I didn’t recall <em>ever</em> saving a draft in Movable Type, but, I thought to myself, I probably did it from my phone — which is the one device where I do publish and edit posts through the MT web interface because (to my knowledge) there’s no equivalent of MarsEdit for iOS.</p>\n\n<p>It was a Linked List post pointing to <a href=\"https://lefsetz.com/wordpress/2014/05/29/beats-deal/\">Bob Lefsetz’s reaction</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2014/05/28Apple-to-Acquire-Beats-Music-Beats-Electronics/\">then-new Beats acquisition by Apple</a> for $3 billion, which was considered a lot of money for an acquisition at the time. The blockquote wasn’t fully Markdown-formatted yet — which is sort of tedious for me on the phone, but a single keyboard shortcut in either BBEdit or MarsEdit on my Mac. That’s probably why I left it as a draft. So, just now, I finished the formatting, and changed it from draft to published. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/01/lefsetz\">Voila</a> — a post I wrote on 1 June 2014 that hadn’t been published until a few minutes ago. I suspect many of you will think Lefsetz’s 2014 remarks on Tim Cook ring more true today than they did then.</p>\n\n<p>Lending strong credence to my theory that this forgotten draft was created on my phone is that 1 June 2014 was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2014/06/wwdc_2014_prelude\">the Sunday before WWDC 2014</a>, when I’d have been travelling, and thus using my phone for posting. Funny coincidence that I happened to notice it today, on the cusp of WWDC 2025.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/07/long-lost-df-post\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dddbee335031fabe004433e94c9bf3985e6e245831f6b030782339bcf04eb687","category":"Tech"}
